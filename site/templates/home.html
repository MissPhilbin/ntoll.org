<p>It was <a href="http://pyconuk.org">PyconUK</a> 2012 over the final weekend
of September.</p>

<p>PyconUK is a community organised conference focussed on the
<a href="http://python.org/">Python programming language</a> for UK based
developers and other interested parties. This year I was both an attendee and
organiser and this post is a review of my personal highlights.</p>

<p>Actually, I'd like to start by explaining the work that's required to
organise a conference such as PyconUK. First, PyconUK has a great reputation:
it is great value for money (&pound;100 a ticket if you booked as an early bird),
packed full of excellent talks and has a very friendly atmosphere. This is
due to the "tone" set by the originators of the conference back when it
first started five or six years ago. Happily many of the original team are
still involved and it has been an education watching what and how they
organise things.</p>

<p>Since this is a community organised conference all organisers are
volunteers. Most of our interaction was via weekly IRC meetings, although
sometimes we'd find a pub in a vaguely central location (we're
all based in the Midlands) and conduct business
over a friendly pint. In either case, meetings were business like, tended to
be waffle free and always ended in clearly defined and delegated tasks.
There's no room for fanny-annying around when organising PyconUK!</p>

<p>I was principally involved in three tasks:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.pyconuk.net/CodeOfConduct">diversity and code
of conduct statement</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="http://2012.pyconuk.net/PyConUKsong">conference song</a>
(!)</li>
    <li>The education track (see below).</li>
</ol>

<p>It is a sad fact that having a diversity statement and/or code of conduct
for a free software conference is becoming the norm. One would hope that
attendees at free software conferences (whose communities value openness, merit
and collaboration) would understand that sexism, racism and all
other forms of prejudicial behaviours are completely unacceptable. Unfortunately,
recent and very public cases at other free software related conferences have
shown that some people are clueless idiots. It is through their moronic
actions that our communities are brought into disrepute
(happily, to my knowledge, PyconUK has never had to deal with such
misdemeanours). We acknowledged the need for such a statement: it would
clearly state the expectations of the wider Python community within the UK and
give us, the organisers, a set of options for dealing with potential idiots.
However, we strongly felt that we <em>didn't</em> want to follow the example of
some other conferences with a list of condescending rules that curtailed
freedom of expression in all its glorious manifestations. These are complex
issues that a mere set of rules would simply aggravate. I contacted a couple
of other "Pycons" (our Italian friends at
<a href="http://europython.eu/">Europython</a> and antipodean cousins at
<a href="http://pycon-au.org">PyconAu</a>) for advice and drafted something
that attempted to walk the fine line between expectation and curtailment. After
feedback from both the other PyconUK organisers and the wider Python community
in the UK, it was adopted. In case you're interested, it's released under a

always most welcome.</p>

<p>I never imagined I'd be writing, arranging and recording a conference song,
but, thanks to fellow organiser, design guru and "bloke in charge of publicity"
<a href="https://twitter.com/hawkz">Steve Hawkes</a>, it was decided that one
was needed. Given that I have a musical background I was drafted in to help.
Steve's idea was to do a version of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_(song)">elements song</a>
but for all the Python language's keywords. This is a classic "patter" song
and is itself based upon the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major-General%27s_Song">Major General's Song</a>
from Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance">The Pirates of
Penzance</a>. It also fitted quite nicely with the "Victorian" snakes vibe that
Steve was using in his designs - Gilbert and Sullivan are very much a Victorian
phenomenon. A couple of Skype calls and various emails later we had the words
sorted out. We attempted to engage the services of a "proper singer" but in the
end it fell to me to sing the damn thing (and many thanks to my mate,
<a href="https://twitter.com/darrengoldsmith">Darren Goldsmith</a>, who acted
as sound engineer and producer). You can find the results
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/programmer_pythonical">at this GitHub
repository</a>. Please feel free to suggest new lines and verses via pull
requests! At some point in the not-too-distant future we hope to record a group
of Pythonistas singing the chorus (watch out London Python Code Dojo). We were
hoping to do this at the conference itself but lack of time and the fact that I
lost my voice meant we were unable to fulfil this desire.</p>

<p>In any case, Steve caught the G&amp;S vibe and produced some quite brilliant
t-shirts and personalised mugs quoting lines from the song (see the example on
the right). I really can't wait
to see what he comes up with for next year's conference. I suspect finding a
strong UK based theme is an essential element. We did "The Blitz" last year,
Victorians this year and I'm starting to worry we're turning into something
akin to a Blackadder version of British history given the choices we've been
making. ;-)</p>

<p>How about a bonnets and blouses Jane Austen theme or perhaps something
Elizabethan? Maybe we could go more modern and adopt the swinging sixties as
a touchstone (Austin Powers..?) or Punk?</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Steve's thoughts on the matter are...</p>

<p>Given the interest in <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a>
(apparently so called because it runs a programming language called "Python"
- just fancy that?) and the teaching of programming in schools (see my blog
posts <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/baking-with-raspberrypipy">here</a>
and <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/teach-our-kids-to-code-or-not">here</a>)
it was suggested that "education" would be a good theme. As I used to
be a teacher I stepped up to bring my colleagues past and present together in
an "education" track.</p>

<p>We, the Python community, have been presented with an opportunity: the
resurgence of interest in the teaching of programming to children
has caused a lot of people to look to Python. Many teachers of ICT (that'd be
Information and Communication Technology) don't have any programming experience
and the thought of teaching such a weird, abstract and potentially
complex activity to a room of thirty kids of mixed ability is likely to fill
them with horror. The question of what should be taught is also moot (hence the
interest in Python). I personally think the promotion and practice of
"computational thinking" facilitated via a language such as Python (but done in
as language neutral way as possible) is the way to go. Obviously (and I'm being
very cynical here), incumbent interests in educational ICT and companies within
the IT industry will be interested in promoting their platform as the mechanism
to "teach the kids to code" (whatever that may mean).</p>

<p>At PyconUK we simply wanted to find out how best to meet the needs of
teachers and show them what it's like to be a part of a free software community
with all that entails: collaboration, debate, openness, meritocracy, sharing of
resources and learning from the examples of others.</p>

<p>So our aim was simple: if you bring two diverse groups of intelligent and
motivated people together interesting things are bound to happen. It turns out
we were correct! I'm especially grateful to
<a href="https://twitter.com/teknoteacher">Alan O'Donohoe</a> for helping me
get the word out (most of the teachers I know are music, rather than ICT,
teachers) and Alan has quite a cult status among those "in the know" about all
things ICT. This culminated in a Google hangout where I was given
the opportunity to promote our event to anyone who happened to drop by:</p>

<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PAqQklpZXGc?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PAqQklpZXGc?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

<p>It turns out that quite a number of teachers were interested but getting
them to come along was quite hard - the current squeeze on school budgets
and indifference of management being the two primary causes. Nevertheless, we
almost had a whole cohort of 30 trainee ICT teachers turn up but, alas, funding
nipped that in the bud.</p>

<p>In the end we had about ten teachers in total turn up over the weekend and
an abundance of developers who wanted to dive in and help.
On the Saturday morning was an
"<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/pyintro">Introducing Python</a>" workshop that
<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPinner">John Pinner</a> and I ran and there
were also a handful of talks on several education related projects over the
duration of the conference (for example, Mike Sandford's
<a href="http://pyconuk.net/Talks/TurtleModule">talk</a> about the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/turtle.html">turtle</a> module).</p>

<p>Sunday morning was perhaps the highlight of the weekend for me as both
teachers and developers rolled up their collective sleeves and took part in an
"education sprint" (a sprint, in the context of a free software conference, is
an intense period of work and collaboration on a specific and clearly defined
project). Here's a group shot of the participants:</p>

<img src="/static/images/pycon2012teachers.jpg" alt="PyconUK 2012 Teachers"/>

<p>We were very lucky to have
<a href="https://twitter.com/MissPhilbin">Carrie Anne Philphin</a> (well
known for her infectious enthusiasm and excellent blog,
<a href="http://www.ictwithmissp.co.uk/">ICT with Miss P</a>) who stepped up
to run a post-it note led session for discovering attendee's interests. It was
a case of worlds colliding. I don't think any of the
developers were aware of the conditions that teachers have to deal with: troll
like network administrators with no interest in helping to promote learning,
locked down laptops that are unusable unless you want to use Word, out-of-date
versions of software that put teachers in the technological stone-age (Internet
Explorer 6!) and all this in
addition to the burden of teaching, marking, planning, social work, behaviour
management, OFSTED inspections and extra-curricular clubs, groups and
activities that form the day to day activities of a teacher.</p>

<p>Once the developers had picked their collective jaws up from the floor,
we agreed to split in to mixed groups of teachers and
developers with a view to quickly drafting outlines of schemes of work, lesson
plans and other educational resources (I spent an enjoyable hour creating a
draft for a scheme of work about text based adventure games). At the end we
came together for a show-and-tell feedback session. The results of the
morning can be found
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/pyconuk-education-sprint-2012">in this
github repository</a>.</p>

<p>A welcome addition to our ranks was PSF chairperson
<a href="https://twitter.com/VanL">Van Lindberg</a> who made significant
contributions to the discussion about adventure games as a vehicle for
learning. Great stuff! In addition, during the Saturday evening PSF member's
meeting Carrie Anne somehow smuggled herself in resulting in much of the ensuing
conversation to be centred around how the PSF could help teachers use
Python (nice one Miss P!). Happily, it looks like an education portal will
become part of the scope for the redesign of the
<a href="http://python.org/">python.org</a> website and hopefully
Carrie-Anne, Alan and teaching colleagues around the world will have a chance
to shape its development.</p>

<p>Actually, there is an <a
href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/events/edusummit/">education summit</a> at
Pycon in California in March and it would be wonderful if both Carrie-Anne and
Alan could be the recipients of grants so they can attend. One thing that
frustrates me about the world of education is the lack of global coordination:
teachers all over the world duplicate, rather than share, each other's efforts.
No matter the local education system, surely an international
community such as Python can bring teachers together to promote the creative
fun that is programming? If we don't, there's a danger that there won't be a
Pycon left in twenty five year's time. After all, when you have teachers as
enthusiastic as Carrie Anne (see her video response to PyconUK below) and Alan
we'd be fools not to support them in their efforts to help the next generation
of hackers discover their programming chops.</p>

<p>Finally, there was the rest of the conference: the lightning talks
(<a href="http://autoview.autotrain.org/mod/autoview/view.php?id=259">video
here</a>) were as funny as ever with
<a href="https://twitter.com/lordmauve">Dan Pope's</a> talk on his gaming
creations bringing the house down (at around the 31 minute mark). I had a lot
of fun parping on my Tuba with
<a href="https://twitter.com/CrostonBen">Ben Croston</a> (who has the excellent
job of brewing beer in a brewery that's automated by Python). You can hear us
at around the 1h:17m mark.
It was great to catch up with so many old friends in the pub or at the
impromptu curry outing (I'm sure I overheard, "can we have a table for 22
please?") and, of course, there were the talks. I think my favourite slide of
the conference is this one from <a href="https://twitter.com/antocuni">Antonio
Cuni</a> who seems to be channelling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in this
graph explaining the phases of a tracing JIT compiler:</p>

<p>I'm already looking forward to next year (just you wait to see what we have
planned).</p>

<h1><a href="/article/nhsitfubar">A Deadly Equation of Acronyms: NHS+IT=FUBAR</a></h1><p class="published_on">Friday 28th September 2012 (07:00PM)</p>

<p>I've recently had the pleasure of taking part in two hacker
events organised within the context of healthcare and, specifically, the UK's
National Health Service (note for Americans who missed the opening of the
Olympics: it's the state sponsored monopoly of "death panels" we use to
decide which of our senior citizens are to be terminated). To be clear (and
more seriously), I am using the term
<em>"hacker"</em> in the way it is used within Information Technology
circles: a hacker is a person with a passion for exploring and solving
problems through writing and sharing software.</p>

<p>Over last weekend I was in Liverpool to attend the second
<a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHS Hackday</a> - a gathering of doctors,
designers and developers. Here's my buddy and the originator of the event,
<a href="http://twitter.com/drcjar">Carl</a>, providing more details about the
aims and objectives of NHS Hackday:</p>

<div>
<object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/sgCgszvGAfI?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/sgCgszvGAfI?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>
</div>

<p>After this, on the Monday and Tuesday, I was invited to take part in a
hackathon organised by the UK's
<a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm">Department of Health</a>. Officials
and big-wigs from the DoH provided a diverse group of ten developers and
designers with a problem: to build an "innovation platform" in 48 hours. Said
big-wigs were on hand to answer questions, provide guidance and give feedback
throughout Monday. On Tuesday afternoon we presented our work to a couple of
them.</p>

<p>Both events were positive, energetic and fun. Unfortunately, they also led
me to the conclusion that Information Technology (IT) provision within the
National Health Service (NHS) is Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition (FUBAR).
While I concede this assertion is intentionally couched in a provocative way,
I doubt the sentiment will come as a surprise to those working within the
NHS.</p>

<p>Taking each event in turn, I'd like to explain why I've reached this
conclusion since it's important to back up such negative assertions with
concrete evidence (unfortunately, these two events provide plenty of material).
</p>

<h2>NHS Hackday - The ePortfolio Data Liberation Front</h2>

<p>The modus operandi of the weekend was simple: anyone
could pitch an idea as a lightning talk on the Saturday morning (lightning
talks are strictly time bound - in this case, two minutes), people came
together to investigate and work on the most interesting things presented and,
on the Sunday afternoon, presented the fruits of their labours to a panel of
experts and big-wigs from the worlds of health and technology. If they were
lucky, they got a prize.</p>

<p>Somehow, I got involved in a group called the ePortfolio Data Liberation
Front...</p>

<p>Every junior doctor working as a physician within the UK's hospitals has to
demonstrate that they're at least competent given their level of
training. As a result the Royal Colleges require trainees to undergo
observation and assessment.</p>

<p>This is essential for ensuring patient safety (I, for one, wouldn't
want to be treated by a doctor who couldn't show the required competencies in
order to practice). It is also an important pillar of a hospital doctor's
continuing professional development: a mechanism for feedback, advice and
noting areas for improvement.</p>

<p>The results of this process, the evidence the doctor needs in order to
progress to the next level of training, are currently stored in one mandatory
location: the <a href="http://www.nhseportfolios.org">nhs-eportfolio</a>.
Trainees are obliged to pay &pound;18 a year to use this service, usually as part
of their annual membership fee for whichever of the Royal Colleges they happen
to belong to. The
<a href="https://www.nhseportfolios.org/Anon/AboutUs.aspx">ePortfolio's about
Page</a> states that they have over 35,000 trainees registered. So at a
conservative guess (35000 times 18) their annual income is at least &pound;630,000.
</p>

<p>One would hope that such an important and widely used service would be great
value for money and the beneficiary of continued investment, improvement and
updates.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not the case.</p>

<p>It appears that ePortfolio is loathed by its users to the
extent that there are even
<a href="http://nhseportfoliorevolution.wordpress.com/">blogs</a> about how
awful it is. Users complain that it's unintuitive, disorganised, ugly to look
at and, at times of peak usage, slow. Results from a quick straw poll of doctors
and consultants at the hack day were unanimously negative (and sometimes
venomous).</p>

<p>I happened to meet the author of the afore mention blog, <a
href="http://twitter.com/_elljay_">LJ</a> and another doctor, <a
href="http://twitter.com/marcus_baw">Marcus Baw</a>, on the first morning of the
hack day. We discussed the various problems with the current offering and
quickly came to the conclusion that helping trainee's to get to their data was a
fundamental issue. Unfortunately, there appears to be a conflict
between what is in the ePortfolio's best interest and the interests of their
users.</p>

<p>If a trainee can easily download their data (after all, who else's data is
it?) in a widely used and open
format then there's nothing to stop them from taking their data to a different
service. This is obviously bad news for ePortfolio who are sitting pretty as
a mandatory monopoly. They are not exposed to the pressure of dealing with
a cheaper, better, faster competitor.</p>

<p>We asked ourselves, how hard would it be to extract data from the
ePortfolio and dump it in an industry standard structured data format like,
for example, <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>? The answer is that it's both
easy and hard.</p>

<p>Given a doctor's credentials it's very easy to fool ePortfolio into letting
you in so you're in a position to automate the "scraping" (a colloquial term
to mean downloading, parsing and cleaning) of data. Here's
how I did it using Python (it would have been a lot shorter had their log-in
form not been such a mess):</p>

<pre><code class="python">import requests
import lxml.html
import getpass

LOGIN = 'https://nhseportfolios.org/Anon/Login/Login.aspx'

def getCredentials():
    """
    Asks for user's credentials and returns a (username, password) tuple.
    """
    username = raw_input("Username: ").strip()
    password = getpass.getpass("Password: ").strip()
    return (username, password)


def signIn(username, password):
    """
    Given the username and password of a user will return a correctly
    configured requests.session object to use for subsequent requests.

    This is a slight faff because they include a token in the form to avoid
    naive automated POSTing attacks so we have to HTTP GET the form, extract
    the token and POST back for the session cookies. I'm being lazy and
    returning *everything* they expect in the request (but I guess they're
    just checking the token).
    """
    # Grab the login page to get the form values we need.
    raw = requests.get(LOGIN)
    session_left_slice = raw.headers['set-cookie'].find('=') + 1
    session_right_slice = raw.headers['set-cookie'].find(';')
    session_id = raw.headers['set-cookie'][session_left_slice:session_right_slice]
    html = lxml.html.fromstring(raw.text)
    db_viewstate = html.cssselect("input#__DATABASE_VIEWSTATE")[0].value
    ev_validation = html.cssselect("input#__EVENTVALIDATION")[0].value
    # Create the form payload, many of these fields are empty, but using them
    # so we look *exactly* like a browser.
    username_key = 'ctl00$ContentPlaceHolderMain$ucUserLoginBox$ePortfolioLogin$UserName'
    password_key = 'ctl00$ContentPlaceHolderMain$ucUserLoginBox$ePortfolioLogin$Password'
    login_button = 'ctl00$ContentPlaceHolderMain$ucUserLoginBox$ePortfolioLogin$LoginButton'
    form_payload = {
        'ctl00_ScriptManager1_HiddenField': '',
        '__LASTFOCUS': '',
        '__EVENTTARGET': '',
        '__EVENTARGUMENT': '',
        '__DATABASE_VIEWSTATE': db_viewstate,
        '__VIEWSTATE': '',
        '__SCROLLPOSITIONX': '',
        '__SCROLLPOSITIONY': '',
        '__EVENTVALIDATION': ev_validation,
        username_key: username,
        password_key: password,
        login_button: 'Please wait...',
        'ctl00$ContentPlaceHolderMain$ucCodeLoginBox$txtLoginCode': ''
    }
    session = requests.session()
    session.post(PATHS['login'], data = form_payload)
    return session

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "Enter user credentials"
    username, password = getCredentials()
    print "Validating user credentials"
    session = signIn(username, password)
</code></pre>

<p>So far, so good. Given the <code>session</code> object created above, it's
simple to download the HTML as if you were a logged in user:</p>

<pre><code class="python"># Get the user's home page.
home = session.get('https://nhseportfolios.org/Auth/SitePages/Trainee/Default.aspx')
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the HTML that ePortfolio returns is terrible.</p>

<img src="/static/images/shit.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 16px;"/>

<p>It is inconsistent, un-idiomatic (I saw at least one nested table), contains
little or no semantic stylesheet or id attributes and is a veritable tag soup of
awfulness. As a result, extracting the important data from the raw HTML was
a tale of woe. It was the cause of most of my frustrations over the weekend.
I'd have had more fun sticking forks in my eyes.</p>

<p>My immediate reaction was a feeling of <a href="http://www.quora.com/wordsthatshouldexistinenglish/Fremdsch%C3%A4men-German-to-feel-ashamed-for-somebody-else-but-also-instead-of-somebody-else-who-actually-should-feel">fremdsch&auml;men</a>.
Surely the developers at ePortfolio were aware that from both a non-technical
"external" point of view and a technical "internal" view (of their HTML) the site
sucked harder than a black hole? How could who-ever is in charge of ePortfolio
allow this to happen?</p>

<p>Then I remembered that the reason ePortfolio is allowed to continue in this
state is that they have no external pressure for them to change. Whoever
decided to make the system a mandatory monopoly was, not to put too finer point
on it, hugely misinformed, unconcerned with trainee doctor's requirements and
foolish.</p>

<p>Happily, working with such a smart, motivated and jolly couple of doctors
was the highlight of the weekend because they are a beacon of hope. LJ and
Marcus understand technology and care passionately that it becomes a force for
good: improving healthcare in the UK rather than continuing to be the root of so
much frustration. Obviously, people like them should be in charge of making
IT precurement decisions.</p>

<p>I'm also pleased that we were awarded second place by the judges.
A better prize would be to open-source the ePortfolio
and give trainee doctors free access to their own data.</p>

<p>For LJ's perspective on the weekend check out
<a href="http://nhseportfoliorevolution.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/nhs-hackday-and-the-eportfolio-data-liberation-front/">her blog post</a>
and the resulting exchange of comments with one of ePortfolio's developers.</p>

<h2>Sonar - Surfacing Innovation from within the NHS</h2>

<p>Arriving home, hot foot from Liverpool, I was immediately travelling down to
London for, well, I wasn't sure what...</p>

<p>Ten developers and designers gathered at the Design Council in London under
the auspices of the Department of Health. We also met managers from the health
care sector. The managers had decided that the NHS needed an
"innovation platform to surface best practice" (or something like that). Once we'd parsed the
<a href="http://www.bullshitbingo.net/">buzzword bingo</a> it became clear that
they wanted something akin to
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> (the premier website
where hackers and tech start-ups share innovation) or
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> (a news website containing content
submitted by its members). In both instances, attention is given to those
stories that the site's members vote as most interesting.</p>

<p>Given the amount of "surfacing" jargon going on in the room we (the hackers)
decided to create <a href="http://nhs-innovation.herokuapp.com/">NHSonar</a>,
a site for surfacing innovation within the NHS.</p>

<img src="/static/images/sonar.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 16px;"/>

<p>It was a lot of fun and we managed to build something close to the manager's
original vision (you should be able to submit innovations upon which
other users could vote and comment with the most popular innovations on the
front page). All this was done within two working days.</p>

<p>So we come to the crux of this blog post: expensive, badly written software
that's foisted on healthcare professionals via a top-down style of management
results in the terrible state we're in
right now. Happily, despite having their collective legs pulled about the
over use of business buzzwords, enlightened healthcare managers understand that
"surfacing innovation" is an essential part of stopping the rot.</p>

<p>If a handful of hacker-types working in an agile manner with
open-source tools can create an innovation site in 48 hours, can you imagine
what might be achieved if the government, senior healthcare professionals
and managers engaged with the free software community?</p>

<p>One positive outcome would be managers that don't speak "buzzword" - they'd
be fluent in "techno-babble" instead. Perhaps, on second thoughts...</p>

<p><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> is an easy-to-learn modern
programming language with a simple yet elegant implementation of object
orientation. This post explains one dark corner of Python's implementation of
object orientation: metaclasses (but does so as if explaining the <a
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/learningenglish/2011/09/howzat.shtml">rules
of cricket</a>).</p>

<p>Objects represent things. Type, <code>type(my_object)</code> to find out
what type of thing your object is. The type of thing an object represents is
defined by its "type". Classes define types of things to be instantiated as
objects. To be absolutely clear, objects represent types of things defined by
classes.</p>

<p>Now, listen carefully!</p>

<p>In Python, classes <strong>are also</strong> objects. This raises
an important question: what type of thing is a class?</p>

<p>The answer is that a class is a type of thing that can instantiate objects.
This type of thing (a class's class) is a class's metaclass which, incidently,
in Python defaults to a special class called <code>type</code> ~ whose type
is, circularly, <code>type</code> (i.e. itself).</p>

<p>You can change the metaclass of a class by setting it's
<code>__metaclass__</code> attribute to a class that inherits from the
<code>type</code> class. With this sleight-of-hand you can control how classes
instantiate objects.</p>

<p>How? I'm so pleased you asked!</p>

<p>Override the new metaclass's <code>__new__</code> method.
Remember, this <code>__new__</code> method must return the return of a call
to the <code>type</code> class's <code>__new__</code> method so your new class
correctly instantiates a new object of the correct type.</p>

<p>Got it? Good!</p>
