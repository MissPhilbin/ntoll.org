<h1><a href="/article/drogulus-questions-and-clarifications">Drogulus - Questions and Clarifications</a></h1><p class="published_on">Wednesday 22nd May 2013 (8:00AM)</p>

<p>Last weekend I gave a very short (15 minute)
<a href="/article/ppdd">talk on the drogulus</a>: a programmable peer-to-peer
data store that I've been working on in my own time. Pretty much all my answers
in the short Q/A that followed were a variation of "I don't know". I consider
this a success since it provided evidence for future avenues of investigation
that others have proposed about the drogulus (one of the purposes for giving
the talk).</p>

<p>I prefer to say "I don't know" then think about the problem and write a
considered response. I've had a couple of days to ponder the questions and
comments from the Q/A (and later discussions in the bar), and in this post I'll
attempt to answer, clarify or admit that, even upon reflection, I still don't
know.</p>

<p>I'll assume you've read the <a href="/article/ppdd">blog post of the
talk</a> before reading the following.</p>

<p><strong>What about flooding the network with Logos jobs? (or) How do you
solve the problem of the tragedy of the commons?</strong></p>

<p>Upon reflection I think this <em>is</em> a solvable problem. Put simply,
there must be costs for misbehaviour and rewards for collaboration. I
think a mechanism that uses both carrot and stick could be a solution (note
that I didn't say, <em>is the answer</em>). My guess is that the specifics of
a solution will become clearer if/when the drogulus gets used.</p>

<p>The drogulus is a peer-to-peer system: by virtue of the way the system works
peers have evidence of how each other behave. The ultimate punishment is to
ostracise misbehaving nodes from the network, cutting them off from data and
the latent computing power within the drogulus.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to run Logos jobs, nodes must have shown evidence that
they are "good citizens" of the network. Furthermore, there is the threat that
evidence of "bad" behaviour will result in punishment.</p>

<p>To some extent this feature already exists within the drogulus: every node
maintains a simple data structure called a
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/drogulus/dht/routingtable.py">routing table</a>
- the means of keeping track of peers on the network. To get in to another
node's routing table you must have been in contact with the node and
provided some useful information in a timely fashion. The number of
available slots in the routing table is limited by a constant called
<code>K</code>. Only the most reliable nodes get included in node's routing
tables and those that do not maintain good performance are removed and quickly
replaced.</p>

<p>In this way, the distributed hash table's nodes attempt to use the most
reliable peers to maintain the system's performance. Furthermore, if a node is
found to propagate a value that fails the cryptographic checks it is
immediately removed from routing tables no matter how reliable its prior
performance.</p>

<p>Something similar could be achieved for running Logos scripts. For example,
peers may only run Logos jobs from remote nodes that have already run a Logos
job for them (you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours) or from nodes that have
existed within the routing table and fulfilled a certain number of successful
interactions with the local node.</p>

<p>My aim is simply to think up a mechanism by which it costs nothing to be
a good citizen yet is fatally expensive to be disruptive.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if a third party attempts to block by IP
address?</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in the talk, areas of the key space are covered by many
different nodes. The IP address of a node has nothing to do with the key space
it covers. I presume a third party would be attempting to block access to a
key/value item stored in the drogulus rather than a specific machine. To block
an area of the key space a third party would have to take down
<strong>all</strong> nodes containing the target key/value item.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is easier said than done because:</p>

<ul>
    <li>There is no central list tracking which nodes contain what values.
    There's a pretty good chance you won't discover them all at any single
    point in time.</li>
    <li>Nodes are constantly joining and leaving the drogulus and replicating
    data between each other. The set of nodes containing a certain item is
    constantly changing.
    &#928;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8165;&#949;&#8150;.</li>
    <li>If nodes <em>are</em> blocked then the drogulus quickly routes around
    the failing nodes through the mechanism of the routing table (see
    above).</li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine some of the properties of the drogulus are like a
swarming flock of starlings: a dynamic system consisting of a multitude of
independent parts that are constantly acting on and reacting to each other.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/swarm.jpg" alt="Swarm of starlings"/></p>

<p><strong>What is the etymology of "drogulus" and "logos"?</strong></p>

<p>A drogulus is an entity whose presence is unverifiable, because it has no
physical effects. The atheist philosopher
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Ayer">A.J.Ayer</a>
coined it as a way of ridiculing the belief system of his friend, the Jesuit
philosopher,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Copleston">Frederick
Copleston</a>.</p>

<p>In 1949 Ayer and Copleston took part in a radio debate about the existence of
God. The debate then went back and forth, until Ayer came up with the following
as a way of illustrating the point that Copleston's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>
had no content
because there was no way of testing the truth of metaphysical assertions. He
said:</p>

<blockquote>"I say, 'There's a "drogulus" over there,' and you say, 'What?' and
I say, 'drogulus' and you say 'What's a drogulus?' Well, I say, 'I can't
describe what a drogulus is, because it's not the sort of thing you can see or
touch, it has no physical effects of any kind, but it's a disembodied
being.' And you say, 'Well how am I to tell if it's there or it's not
there?' and I say, 'There's no way of telling. Everything's just the same
if it's there or it's not there. But the fact is it's there. There's a
drogulus there standing just behind you, spiritually behind you.' Does that
makes sense?"</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the natural answer Ayer was waiting for was "No, of course it
doesn't make sense." Therefore, the implication would be that metaphysics is
like the "drogulus" ~ a being which cannot be seen and has no perceptible
effects. If Ayer can get to that point, he can claim that any kind of belief
in the Christian God or in metaphysical principles in general is really
contrary to our logical and scientific understanding of the world.</p>

<p>This appeals greatly to my sense of humour and I've always thought it'd be
a fun name for a software project. Especially a project like this one. :-)</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/ajayer.jpg" alt="Portrait of A.J.Ayer"/><br/>
<small>A.J.Ayer</small></p>

<p>Logos
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</a>)
is a term used by the pre-Socratic philosopher,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, to mean
several different things: account, explanation, reason, organising principle,
wisdom, nature or saying. It's the etymological root of the modern
English word "logic". I do not use it in the biblical sense where it means
the word of God (I refer readers to the explanation of "drogulus" above).</p>

<p>It seems to me an appropriate choice of name for a computer language.</p>

<p><strong>It's a complex problem and you don't know what you're
doing!</strong></p>

<p>I won't contest that!</p>

<p>It's a fun personal project. If it is useful then people will use
it. At the very least it's a helpful learning exercise for me (which is, in
itself, a positive outcome).</p>

<p>However, a complex problem may not entail a complex solution. Rather, it
only needs to work. Furthermore, while thinking about the drogulus I've
attempted to work out the simplest possible solution given whatever the
abstract problem I've needed to solve.</p>

<p>As computing pioneer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony
Hoare</a> explains,</p>

<blockquote>"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is
to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other
way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The
first method is far more difficult."</blockquote>

<p>I'm aiming for Hoare's first method of constructing software.</p>

<p><strong>What's being sent down the wire?</strong></p>

<p>Dictionary like objects (that are themselves valid statements in Logos) are
encoded using <a href="http://msgpack.org/">msgpack</a> and sent as a
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt">netstring</a> to remote nodes
over
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite">TCP/IP</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How does the cryptographic signing work?</strong></p>

<p>The relevant code can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/drogulus/crypto.py">crypto.py</a>
module. I use the popular
<a href="https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto">PyCrypto</a> library for all
cryptographic functionality.</p>

<p>Put simply, each item encompassing a key/value pair includes the following
fields:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>value</code> - the value to store</li>
    <li><code>timestamp</code> - a UNIX timestamp representing when the item
    was created (so it's easy to discern the latest version of an item)</li>
    <li><code>expires</code> - a UNIX timestamp beyond which the item is
    expired and should be ignored</li>
    <li><code>name</code> - a meaningful name for the key</li>
    <li><code>meta</code> - a list of tuples containing key/value strings for
    user defined metadata about the item</li>
    <li><code>public_key</code> - the originator's public key</li>
    <li><code>sig</code> - a cryptographic signature created using the
    originator's private key with the <code>value</code>,
    <code>timestamp</code>, <code>expires</code>, <code>name</code> and
    <code>meta</code> values</li>
    <li><code>key</code> - the SHA512 value of the compound key (based upon the
    <code>public_key</code> and <code>name</code> fields) used as the actual
    key on the distributed hash table</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>public_key</code> field is used to validate the <code>sig</code>
value. If this is OK then the compound key is checked using the obviously valid
<code>public_key</code> and <code>name</code> fields.</p>

<p>This ensures both the provenance of the data and that it hasn't been
tampered with.</p>

<p>Any items that don't pass the cryptographic checks are ignored and nodes
that propagate them are punished by being blocked.</p>

<p><strong>How is it licensed?</strong></p>

<p>Under the
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/LICENSE">GNU Affero
general public license version 3</a>. I usually license my code under a more
liberal license (e.g. the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>
license) but decided to use the AGPLv3 because this is the reference version of
the drogulus and should always remain open (if anything comes of the drogulus,
I hope many different implementations will exist).</p>

<p><strong>Do you want or need help?</strong></p>

<h1><a href="/article/ppdd">Politics, Programming, Data and the Drogulus</a></h1><p class="published_on">Saturday 18th May 2013 (4:00PM)</p>
<p><small>(This article is based upon a short talk I gave at
<a href="http://www.opentech.org.uk/2013/">Opentech</a> 2013.)</small></p>

<p><img src="/static/images/drogulus.png" alt="Drogulus logo"/></p>

<p>I'm going to describe the <a href="http://drogul.us">drogulus</a>: a
programmable peer-to-peer data store that I've been hacking on in my spare
time.</p>

<p>The problem I have is a growing unease with the current state of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">web</a>. This unease can
be summed up in three ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li><em>On the web, users are no longer in control of their data or online
    identity.</em> They're locked in to websites that act as walled gardens of
    data each of which requires different credentials in order to log in. Once
    logged in there is often no way to extract data. Furthermore, how can we
    tell who's who? Is <em>user X</em> on Twitter the same <em>user X</em> on
    Facebook?</li>

    <li><em>Programmers have to build stuff on the web using complicated and
    quirky technology defined in a top down manner by committee.</em> Just
    watch any web developer grimace if you mention
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth</a>,
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a>, Javascript
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">date objects</a>
    or (dare I say it)
    <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/">Internet Explorer</a>.</li>

    <li><em>There are many inadvertent points of control, lock-in and authority
    built in to the web - each of which is a potential mechanism for
    dis-empowerment and exploitation</em>. Just look at the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall_of_China#Technical_implementation">great firewall of China</a>,
    the censorship of the
    <a href="http://unblockedpiratebay.com/">Piratebay</a>
    here in the UK or the kerfuffle over payment to
    <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The beautifully simple, open and decentralised hypertext system envisioned
by Tim Berners-Lee has grown in to a closed, centralised and complicated
monster beholden to dodgy commercial, political and legal manipulation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many aspects of today's web are contrary to a concept that is
very important to me: autonomy.</p>

<p>When someone is autonomous they are self-directing, free to act of their own
accord and lack imposition from others. Autonomy also suggests intelligence and
awareness enough to be able to enjoy and make use of such freedom. Furthermore,
such intelligence entails decision making so people become accountable for
their actions. Autonomy is also the opposite of such undesirable states as
tyranny, slavery, ignorance and apathy.</p>

<p>I asked myself, how would software designed to promote autonomy function? I
started to hack and the drogulus was born.</p>

<p>The drogulus is a speculative exercise in
<a href="/article/p2p-concise-and-simple">peer-to-peer</a> decentralisation, a
political statement (it promotes a certain point of view about technology's
role in society) and is a place for me to explore fun ideas that have been
knocking around in my head for a while.</p>

<p>I tell myself, "it'll all come to nothing" but I'm having too much fun to
stop, so I want to tell you about the drogulus to give you a sense of why I
find it so fascinating.</p>

<p>So, how is the drogulus designed to promote digital autonomy?</p>

<p>It's a global federated, decentralized and open data store that can be
programmed by anyone. Identity and provenance is ensured by
<a href="http://ntoll.org/article/public-key-crypto-concise-and-simple">cryptographically signing</a>
digital assets.</p>

<p>Being federated (the system consists of many independent but collaborating
entities) and decentralized (no entity is more important than the others)
ensures users are free from choke points of authority that may be used to
control access to data and usage of the system.</p>

<p>Being an open system means all users are free to contribute, change, enhance
and expand the system without prejudice.</p>

<p>Being programmable means users can do something with the data stored within
the drogulus. It's a sort of distributed programming environment. Imagine it as
a re-configurable <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a>
on steroids: by running a node in the drogulus network you are sharing a small
amount of your potential computing power with everyone else on the network.</p>

<p> By using public key cryptography the drogulus ensures the provenance of the
data and that it has not been tampered with. Importantly, there is no central
authority to prove who's who. Identity is built on the far more humane
mechanism of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a>.</p>

<p>So how does it work? Well, there are three simple core components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed
  hash table</a> (DHT) that provides the data store and allows users to find
  each other.</li>
  <li>Trust and identity enforced by the afore mentioned
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">cryptographic
  signing</a> of digital assets.</li>
  <li>Logos
  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</a>),
  a simple
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>
  like programming language for asynchronously working with data stored in the
  distributed hash table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each component promotes autonomy in the following ways:</p>

<p>A distributed hash table works like a sort of peer-to-peer dictionary: a
unique key is used to identify a value. In the case of a traditional
dictionary, the key is a word and the value is its definition. Being a data
store, the distributed hash table allows users to create, retrieve, update and
delete their own keys and associated digital values.</p>

<p>The hash table is distributed because it is split in to the equivalent of
many volumes of a traditional dictionary. Each person who ever uses the
dictionary has a copy of just one volume with many copies of the same volume
being distributed to many different users.</p>

<p>Users keep track of which of their friends on the network hold what volume.
Users interact with the distributed hash table by contacting the friend with
the correct volume for the desired item. If they don't know anyone with the
right volume they play a sort of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">six-degrees-of-separation</a>
game with their friends until someone with the correct volume is found.</p>

<p>Distributed hash tables also share an interesting property with
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">Bittorrent</a>: the more popular an entry
is the more widespread it becomes, thus improving performance since popular
items are easier to find.</p>

<p>The drogulus implements a version of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> distributed hash
table algorithm. The innovation the drogulus brings is that keys and values are
signed in such a way that their provenance can be proven and content shown to
be intact. Furthermore, users cannot interfere with each other's items stored
within the distributed hash table unless they have access to the same private
key.</p>

<p>Items are self contained and any that do not pass the cryptographic checks
are ignored and nodes on the network that attempt to propagate such values are
punished by being blocked by their peers.</p>

<p>Programming the drogulus is done via Logos, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconic</a> language:
this means code and data are the same thing in Logos. This has the interesting
mind-bending side effect that Logos programs can rewrite other Logos programs
in order to extend the Logos programming language itself. This is an important
property: users have the autonomy to grow the Logos programming language to
suit their own needs.</p>

<p>Since Logos programs are also data they are stored as values within the
distributed hash table so users can re-use each other's code.</p>

<p>They run in asynchronous "ensembles" on other nodes in the drogulus network.
The result is delivered when the ensemble eventually arrives at a consensus. To
protect peers, Logos programs are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxed</a>
and intentionally limited in terms of time (how long they can run for) and
space (how much memory may be used).</p>

<p>At each point in hacking together the drogulus I've tried to build a
solution whose outcomes reflect my ethical and political considerations: a
focus on autonomy and openness and the removal of authority and choke
points.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the drogulus is unfinished! Currently, the distributed hash
table is almost done, the cryptographic layer is finished and Logos is in the
advanced planning stages with some experimental code written.</p>

<p>It's early days and I realise that there are potential contradictions and
problems that I've not worked out, nor is there anything useful that can be
achieved with the drogulus at this moment in time. Because I'm working at such
an abstract level it's hard for me to comprehend what use others may find for a
programmable peer-to-peer data store. That's why I wanted to present the
drogulus in its current incomplete state: to gauge what sort of reaction (if
any) it might get.</p>

<p>I'll finish by pointing out that in 1996
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a>
described the web as merely the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html?pagewanted=all">test card for 21st century technology</a>.
I'd like to think we can do better than the web. Thinking outside its confines
has been a liberating experience and I'd encourage everyone to do the same.
Obviously the drogulus is the rough and ready result of such pondering by
me.</p>

<p>We'd only have ourselves to blame if we don't imagine and build something
better than the test card that is the web. After all, if there's one thing that
the web has taught us, it is that engineering software is a far more useful,
tangible and easier agent of change than traditional means of political
engagement.</p>

<p>The code is on <a href="http://github.com/ntoll/drogulus">GitHub</a> and
I've created a simple <a href="http://drogul.us">website</a> that explains
things further. If you have any questions please drop me an
<a href="/contact">email</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Most of the technical questions I was asked resulted
in me saying, "I don't know". I consider this a good thing. It was interesting
that someone picked up on etymological fun I've been having with this project.

<h1><a href="/article/doitreatthisimmigrant">App for Doctors: Do I Treat This Immigrant?</a></h1><p class="published_on">Saturday 11th May 2013 (6:30PM)</p>

<p>I've just built (in all of 20 minutes) a
