<h1><a href="/article/long-term-view">Taking the Long Term View</a></h1><p class="published_on">Thursday 28th March 2013 (8:00AM)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a> is one of my
favourite places because it forces me to take on a perspective of 5000 years
or more. Take the
<a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/tablet,_allocation_of_beer.aspx">Mesopotamian clay tablet</a>
shown below: it records the allocation of beer by administrators in the city
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk">Uruk</a>. The symbol
representing beer is apparently an upright jar with a pointed base, amounts
are notated by circles and semi-circles and, at the bottom left, there is a
figure drinking from a bowl.</p>

<img src="/static/images/15_writingtablet_l.jpg" alt="Mesopotamian tablet"/>

<p>It's about 5100 years old. Now, pause for a moment to consider its age.</p>

<p>The difference in time between today and the era of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra_VII_of_Egypt">Cleopatra</a>
is 1000 years less than the period between the creation of the Mesopotamian
tablet and the era of Caesar and Cleopatra. Put simply, Caesar and Cleopatra
are closer in time to us (by 1000 years) than they are to the Mesopotamian
scribe who recorded the allocation of beer to citizens of Uruk.</p>

<p>It is intriguing that the tablet is political in nature, an instance
of a new technology and of economic interest. Not only is it evidence of the
machinations of the state in Uruk but it demonstrates how a new technology
(writing) changed the capabilities of such a state: for the first time it was
possible to keep records and thus run a bureaucracy on a large scale.
Furthermore, it records receipt of payment requiring concepts such as balance,
debt and a measure of value (in beer).</p>

<p>Such concepts (writing, state bureaucracy and fundamental economics) are
unremarkable in today's world, making it difficult for us to appreciate how
important, strange or unusual they must have seemed when they first appeared. I
wonder what important, strange or unusual aspects of our time will be
unremarkable to our descendants. Furthermore, what aspects of our lives that
seem fixed today will be completely different 5000 years hence?</p>

<p>Guessing the future is a fool's game. As
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> famously
stated,</p>

<blockquote>"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."</blockquote>

<p>Something from today that "<em>invents the future</em>" is
programming, and I'm guessing the
<a href="http://www.informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/wang.html">Lisp program from 1960</a>
copied below is our Mesopotamian tablet for future generations:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(shadow '(trace untrace))
(defun trace   (functions) (eval `(cl:trace   ,@functions)))
(defun untrace (functions) (eval `(cl:untrace ,@functions)))

(defun define (definitions)
  (dolist (def definitions)
    (eval (if (and (consp (second def)) (eq 'lambda (car (second def))))
              `(progn (defun        ,(first def) ,@(cdr (second def)))
                      (defparameter ,(first def) ,(second def)))
              `(defparameter ,(first def) ,(second def))))))

(defun stop (arguments) (throw 'driver-end-of-deck nil))
(defun fin  (arguments) (throw 'driver-end-of-deck nil))
(defun test (arguments) (princ arguments) (terpri))

(defun driver (path)
  (with-open-file (cards path)
    (catch 'driver-end-of-deck
      (loop (let ((first-char (read-char cards)))
              (if (char= #\* first-char)
                  (read-line cards)     ; comment
                  (progn
                    (unread-char first-char cards)
                    (let* ((command   (read cards))
                           (arguments (if (member command '(stop fin test))
                                          (list (read-line cards))
                                          (read cards))))
                      (print (apply command arguments))))))))))</code></pre></p>


<p>Despite this code being more than 50 years old, it is still understandable
to anyone who has read my
<a href="/article/lisp-concise-and-simple">recent Lisp article</a>. Furthermore
it forces me to wonder what the computational world will be like in 5000 years.
I hope the <a href="/article/the-web-concise-and-simple">world wide web</a>
will be long gone and replaced with something much more capable and better
engineered and I guess that new computer architectures will arise to replace
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann</a>
/ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture">Harvard</a>
based models in current use.</p>

<p>Perhaps the final word should be another Alan Kay quote:</p>

<blockquote>"I believe that the only kind of science computing can be is like
the science of bridge building. Somebody has to build the bridges and other
people have to tear them down and make better theories, and you have to keep
on building bridges."</blockquote>

<h1><a href="/article/minecraft-pi">Programming Minecraft on the RaspberryPi</a></h1><p class="published_on">Thursday 16th March 2013 (10:45PM)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MmB9b5njVbA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> is a sort of digital Lego.
Players explore a blocky computer generated world and have the ability to build
new terrain, buildings and other features. Many users have generated creative
and complicated structures within their games by carefully placing individual
bricks (just like Lego). A quick
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=minecraft&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch">Google image search for Minecraft</a> will return lots of amazing results.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi</a> is a cheap
computer designed to encourage kids (of all ages) to learn how to program.
Apparently, the "pi" part of the name is a misspelled reference to the
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language - the RaspberryPi's
principal programming language for education.</p>

<p>Minecraft is amazingly popular among kids (my own included). I guess, like
Lego, it's the potential for creative generative play that is so appealing.
Wouldn't it be great if there were a version of Minecraft that you could
program in Python that ran on the RaspberryPi..?</p>

<p><a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">THERE IS!</a></p>

<p>I'm currently at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyconUS 2013</a> in
California, every attendee has been given a RaspberryPi and there's a
RaspberryPi lab in which attendees are encouraged to try their new piece of
kit. I just spent a fun morning programming Minecraft with Python. What follows
is a quick "how to" guide to get you started.</p>

<p>I'll assume you've got a RaspberryPi to hand and that it's connected to the
internet. (If you're unsure how to do this I suggest you visit the main
<a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">RaspberryPi website</a> for more
information.)</p>

<p>First you should <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/?page_id=10">download the
RaspberryPi version of Minecraft</a> and follow the instructions at the web
page to which I just linked.</p>

<p>Next, once you have Minecraft running on your RaspberryPi I suggest you play
for a while. Create a world and have a look around. Here's a run-down of the
commands you can use:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Keyboard
        <ul>
            <li>W,A,S,D - Move (or navigate inventory)</li>
            <li>SPACE - Jump, double tap to start/stop flying, hold to fly
            higher</li>
            <li>SHIFT - Sneak, hold to fly lower</li>
            <li>E - Open inventory</li>
            <li>1-8 - Select inventory slot item to use</li>
            <li>ESC - Show/hide menu</li>
            <li>TAB - Release mouse without showing menu</li>
            <li>ENTER - Confirm menu selection</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mouse
        <ul>
            <li>Steer - Look/turn around</li>
            <li>Left mouse button - Remove block (hold)</li>
            <li>Right mouse button - Place block, hit block with sword</li>
            <li>Mouse wheel - Select inventory slot item to use</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Cool huh..?</p>

<p>But wouldn't it be fun to be able to program and automate the manipulation
of the game world with Python..?</p>

<p>Here's how to get started...</p>

<p>Open a terminal and change in to the Minecraft directory
(<code>mcpi</code>) within which you'll see a child directory called
<code>api</code> within which is yet another called <code>python</code>. From
within the <code>python</code> directory start Python by typing,
<code>python</code>.</p>

<p>Now, type in the following:</p>

<p><pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; from mcpi import minecraft
&gt;&gt;&gt; mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create("127.0.0.1")
&gt;&gt;&gt; mc.postToChat("Hello, World!")
</code></pre></p>

<p>You should see the message <em>Hello, World!</em> pop up in the Minecraft
world. Congratulations, you've just programmed Minecraft!</p>

<p>The first command imported all the things that Python needs to talk to the
Minecraft game. The second line creates an object called <code>mc</code> that
represents a connection to your game. The third line sends the chat message
to the game.</p>

<p>How about building things within the Minecraft world..? Check this out...</p>

<p><pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; from mcpi import block
&gt;&gt;&gt; mc.player.getTilePos()
Vec3(37,0,-39)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mc.setBlock(38, 0, -38, block.STONE_BRICK.id)
</code></pre></p>

<p>On the first line I import information Python needs about the blocks that
you can place within the Minecraft world. Next, I ask the game where in the
world my player is located. The game responds with an <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>
and <em>z</em> based location expressed as a vector. Finally, I use the
<code>setBlock</code> method to place a stone brick on an adjacent square.
If you take a look around you'll see it right next to you!</p>

<p>Actually, you will see different results to me because your player will be
stood in a different location. See if you can change the final line to place
a block close to your own player's location.</p>

<p>That's it (for now) and covers pretty much all I found out in the first 15
minutes of hacking about. If you want to explore the API further I suggest you
look at the <code>mcpi_protocol_spec.txt</code> file in the
<code>mcpi/api/spec</code> directory.</p>

<p>Personally, I think this is a gift horse that teachers everywhere should be
looking at in the mouth.</p>

<p>I'll blog some more about this when I get back to the UK.</p>

<h1><a href="/article/lisp-concise-and-simple">Lisp ~ Concise and Simple</a></h1><p class="published_on">Thursday 14th March 2013 (10:45PM)</p>

<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/lisplogo_alien.png" alt="Lisp Alien"/></p>

<p>Lisp is a beautiful programming language, famous for its hidden depths that
lead to moments of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensho">kensho</a>. I want to give you
a sense of why I believe this.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/lisp.jpg" alt="Lisp enlightenment"/></p>

<p>For me, Lisp's beauty is revealed when its simple core concepts lead to
moments of sudden insight and shifts of perspective. Lisp's simplicity begins
with its <em>syntax</em> (how it is written): a simple notation that anyone
can understand.</p>

<p>Lisp expressions are either <em>atoms</em> or <em>lists</em> (Lisp stands
for <em>LIS</em>t <em>P</em>rocessor).</p>

<p>Here are five atoms:</p>

<p><pre><code>foo bar baz 123 "Hello World"</code></pre></p>

<p>Atoms are sequences of characters. The penultimate atom is a number and the
final one is a string (enclosed in quotes).</p>

<p>Here's a list:</p>

<p><pre><code>(ham eggs bacon sausages beans)</code></pre></p>

<p>A list is bounded by parenthesis. Lists can contain other lists:</p>

<p><pre><code>((soup salad garlic-mushrooms)
 (roast-beef chicken-casserole vegetable-lasagne)
 (cake fruit jam-pudding))</code></pre></p>

<p>The list above contains three items. Each item is itself another list
containing three atoms. I've split the contained lists over three lines to aid
readability.</p>

<p>Lisp's <em>semantics</em> (that define what the syntax means) are equally
simple:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Code is <em>written as lists</em> that are <em>evaluated</em> by Lisp
    to produce results.</li>
    <li><em>Comments</em> begin with a semi-colon and are ignored by Lisp.</li>
    <li>Lists and atoms that are "<em>quoted</em>" are evaluated as data.</li>
    <li>Anything else is evaluated as a <em>form</em> ~ a list starting with
    an atom that Lisp understands (telling it to do something).</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments are natural-language annotations added to the code by programmers.
They're meant to help humans work out how the code works:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">; This is a comment in Lisp</code></pre></p>

<p>Quoting is a simple concept: it's the difference between <em>quoting</em>
and "quoting" - the former is a word that means something whereas the latter
refers to the word itself. To quote something, append a single quote
(<code>'</code>) to it. Here's a quoted list:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">'(ham eggs bacon sausages beans)</code></pre></p>

<p>Lisp evaluates this as just a list of atoms:</p>

<p><pre><code>(ham eggs bacon sausages beans)</code></pre></p>

<p>Here's an example of a <em>form</em>:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(+ 1 2 3)</code></pre></p>

<p>When Lisp evaluates a form it's told to do something to produce a result. In
this case, the result is <code>6</code>.</p>

<p>If you guessed the result correctly then you've figured out
<em>prefix notation</em>: the command comes first (in this case the atom
representing the <em>operator</em> for summing numbers) and is followed by its
<em>arguments</em> (the things the operator uses to generate the answer).</p>

<p>Can you work out the answer to the following?</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(+ 1 (- 5 (+ 2 3)))</code></pre></p>

<p>If you answered <code>1</code> then you've worked out the order in which
Lisp evaluates nested expressions - it starts from the <em>inner</em> most
expression before evaluating the enclosing <em>outer</em> expressions.</p>

<p>Here's how Lisp evaluated the example above:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(+ 1 (- 5 (+ 2 3)))
(+ 1 (- 5 5))
(+ 1 0)
1</code></pre></p>

<p>Usually, the first item in a form (the <em>operator</em>) is the name of a
<em>function</em>. A function is a discrete block of code that receives input
(its <em>arguments</em>) and returns a result. In the examples above we used
the functions that sum and subtract numbers. Lisp comes with many useful
built-in functions including a special one for creating new functions.</p>

<p id="ref1">I want to describe some fundamental Lisp functions; these will
allow me to reveal a surprise at the heart of
Lisp<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The <code>quote</code> function is a long version of quoting mentioned
above. The example below is equivalent to the abbreviated version
<code class="lisp">'(foo bar baz)</code>:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(quote (foo bar baz))
(foo bar baz)</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>atom</code> function returns the atom <code class="lisp">t</code>
(representing <em>true</em>) if its argument is an atom. Otherwise it
returns <code class="lisp">nil</code> (representing <em>false</em>):</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(atom 'foo)
t
(atom '(foo bar baz))
nil</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>eq</code> function returns <code class="lisp">t</code> if the two
arguments have the same value. Otherwise it returns
<code class="lisp">nil</code>:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(eq 'foo 'foo)
t
(eq 'foo 'bar)
nil</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>car</code> function expects its argument to be a list and returns
the first item therein:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(car '(foo bar baz))
foo</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>cdr</code> function (say kud-r) expects its argument to be a list
and returns everything after the first element:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(cdr '(foo bar baz))
(bar baz)</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>cons</code> function expects two arguments, the second of which
must be a list. It returns a new list containing the first argument followed
by the elements in the second argument:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(cons 'foo '(bar baz))
(foo bar baz)</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>cond</code> (short for <em>conditional</em>) function takes any
number of lists as arguments. Each list must contain two items: a form that
evaluates to either <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code> and some other
expression. Each list is evaluated in order until a form returns <code>t</code>
at which point the other expression in the list is evaluated and returned by
<code>cond</code> :</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(cond ((eq 'foo 'bar) 'first)
      ((atom 'baz) 'second)
      ((atom 'qux) 'third))
second</code></pre></p>

<p>In the example above, the first <code class="lisp">eq</code> function
evaluates to <code class="lisp">nil</code>, whereas the second
<code class="lisp">atom</code> function is true. Therefore, the second element
of the list containing the <code class="lisp">atom</code> function is returned
as the result. Although the third <code class="lisp">atom</code> function is
also true, it is ignored. This is somewhat similar to
<code>if ... elif</code> statements in other programming languages.</p>

<p>The <code>lambda</code> function is used to create user defined functions. It
expects two lists as arguments: the first contains named place-holders for the
new function's arguments, the second contains the form to be evaluated to
generate the new function's result:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(lambda (x y) (cons x (cdr y)))</code></pre></p>

<p>Notice how the argument names are used in the evaluated form to refer to the
values that may be passed in to the new function. This can be demonstrated by
defining then immediately calling a function like this:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">((lambda (x y) (cons x (cdr y)))
 'qux
 '(foo bar baz))
(qux bar baz)</code></pre></p>

<p>The value of <code>x</code> becomes the atom <code>qux</code> and
<code>y</code> becomes the list <code>(foo bar baz)</code>. It's useful
to name new functions. Unsurprisingly, there is a way:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(defun replace-head (x y) (cons x (cdr y)))
(replace-head 'qux '(foo bar baz))
(qux bar baz)</code></pre></p>

<p>The function <code>replace-head</code> is defined
(<code class="lisp">defun</code>) then used to give the result
<code class="lisp">(qux bar baz)</code>. Being able to name a function makes
it possible for the function to refer to itself. This very important behaviour
is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>.
Assuming <code>&lt;=</code> means <em>less than or equal</em> and
<code>*</code> means <em>multiply</em>, can you tell how the following
recursive example works?</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">; Returns the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
(defun factorial (n)
  (cond ((&lt;= n 1) 1)
         ('t (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
(factorial 4)
24</code></pre></p>

<p>After a useful comment a function called <em>factorial</em> (that takes a
single argument called <em>n</em>) is defined. The function checks if
<em>n</em> is less than or equal to 1 and if so returns the number 1.
Otherwise, it returns <em>n</em> multiplied by the result of calling
<em>factorial</em> (i.e. itself) of <em>n</em> minus 1. Finally, the new
function is tested with the number 4, producing the result <code>24</code>.<p>

<p>Recursion is when the function returns <em>n</em> multiplied by
<em>factorial</em> of <em>n</em> minus 1. The value of <em>n</em> keeps
decreasing and is fed back in to the <em>factorial</em> function until
<em>n</em> equals 1, at which point the number 1 is returned to complete
the following chain of arithmetic: 1 &times; 2
&times; 3 &times; 4</p>

<p>Here's the surprise: given the fundamental functions described above, it is
possible to write a Lisp in Lisp. When Lisp <em>evaluates</em> an expression,
a list (the code) is itself an argument to a function that returns the result
of evaluating the code. In Lisp, this function is called <code>eval</code> and
it is possible to define such a function using only the features described
above.</p>

<p>First, some shorthand functions need defining: <code>c<em>x</em>r</code> and
<code>list</code>. The <code>c<em>x</em>r</code> set of functions replace the
<em>x</em> with a sequence of <code>a</code>s or <code>d</code>s to indicate
a corresponding sequence of nested <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code> calls.
For example,</p>

<p><pre><code>(cadr a)</code></pre></p>

<p>is shorthand for:</p>

<p><pre><code>(car (cdr a))</code></pre></p>

returning the second element of <em>a</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>list</code> function returns a list containing a given sequence
of expressions:</p>

<p><pre><code>(list 'a 'b 'c)</code></pre></p>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<p><pre><code>(cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c '())))</code></pre></p>

<p>which returns the list: <code>(a b c)</code>. In many Lisp implementations
the <code>list</code> function is abbreviated to <code>`</code> (backquote).
Remember this, we'll use it later!</p>

<p>Next, we define some useful <em>helper</em> functions:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">; tests if the argument is an empty list.
(defun null? (x)
  (eq x '()))

; returns t if both arguments also return t - otherwise returns nil.
(defun and. (x y)
  (cond (x (cond (y 't) ('t nil)))
        ('t nil)))

; returns t if the argument returns nil, or nil if its argument returns t.
(defun not. (x)
  (cond (x nil)
       ('t 't)))

; concatenates two lists.
(defun append. (x y)
  (cond ((null? x) y)
        ('t (cons (car x) (append. (cdr x) y)))))

; pairs up the elements of two lists of the same length.
; e.g. (pair. '(x y z) '(a b c)) -&gt; ((x a) (y b) (z c))
(defun pair. (x y)
  (cond ((and. (null? x) (null? y)) '())
        ((and. (not. (atom x)) (not. (atom y)))
         (cons (list (car x) (car y))
               (pair. (cdr x) (cdr y))))))

; takes an atom x and list of pairs y and returns the
; second element of the first list in y whose first
; element is x.
; e.g. (assoc. 'x '((x a) (y b))) -&gt; a
(defun assoc. (x y)
  (cond ((eq (caar y) x) (cadar y))
        ('t (assoc. x (cdr y)))))
</code></pre></p>

<p>Notice how the final two functions use recursion as the mechanism for
looping over lists.</p>

<p>Here's the <code>eval</code> function:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">; Lisp's eval function written in Lisp.
; Takes Lisp source code as a list, e, and a context of arguments,
; a, and returns the result of evaluating e in context a.
(defun eval. (e a)
  (cond
    ((atom e) (assoc. e a))
    ((atom (car e))
      (cond
        ((eq (car e) 'quote) (cadr e))
        ((eq (car e) 'atom) (atom (eval. (cadr e) a)))
        ((eq (car e) 'eq) (eq (eval. (cadr e) a)
                              (eval. (caddr e) a)))
        ((eq (car e) 'car) (car (eval. (cadr e) a)))
        ((eq (car e) 'cdr) (cdr (eval. (cadr e) a)))
        ((eq (car e) 'cons) (cons (eval. (cadr e) a)
                                  (eval. (caddr e) a)))
        ((eq (car e) 'cond) (evcon. (cdr e) a))
        ('t (eval. (cons (assoc. (car e) a)
                         (cdr e))
                    a))))
    ((eq (caar e) 'label)
      (eval. (cons (caddar e) (cdr e))
             (cons (list (cadar e) (car e)) a)))

<p>The <code>eval</code> function takes two arguments: <em>e</em> (the
expression to be evaluated) and <em>a</em> (a list of pairs representing the
named parameters passed in as arguments). It evaluates <em>e</em> in the
context of <em>a</em>. The function body is relatively simple: a conditional
containing four clauses for handling atoms, the fundamental functions,
<code>cond</code> statements and the <code>lambda</code> function. The clause
for the fundamental functions is itself a conditional containing sub-clauses
for each fundamental function. The last two clauses call out to the recursive
<code>evcon</code> and <code>evlis</code> functions that evaluate conditionals
and lists respectively.</p>

<p>Notice how <code>eval</code> treats the incoming Lisp source code as a list
to be manipulated like any other data structure. When a language's code is also
<em>merely</em> data (as it is for the <code>eval</code> function above), it is
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconic</a>.
This introduces the potential for yet another mind bending capability: it
is possible to change Lisp from within Lisp since all code is written as lists
and Lisp is a <em>LIS</em>t <em>P</em>rocessor. Therefore, Lisp is able to
transform and change its own source code in order to add unforeseen
features.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#Macros">macro</a> is
what makes this possible. Macros look a lot like functions but are different in
two ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Macros generate Lisp code.</li>
    <li>They are evaluated during <em>macro expansion time</em> - before
    "regular" code is evaluated.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">; A simple macro that generates code to square things
(defmacro square (x)
  `(* ,x ,x))
</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>`</code> is shorthand for the <code>list</code>
function. The <code>,</code> (comma) unquotes an expression (in this case the
argument <em>x</em>). Therefore, the following use of the <code>square</code>
macro:</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(square 3)</code></pre></p>

<p>results in this generated code,</p>

<p><pre><code class="lisp">(* 3 3)</code></pre></p>

<p>that Lisp evaluates to produce a useful result.</p>

<p>Recursion, <code>eval</code> and macros are just three fascinating aspects
of Lisp. Happily, there are many <a href="http://www.alu.org/alu/res-lisp">great</a>
