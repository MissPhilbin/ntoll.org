<h1><a href="/article/p2p-concise-and-simple">Peer to Peer ~ Concise and Simple</a></h1><p class="published_on">Monday 14th January 2012 (08:00AM)</p>

<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p>What is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aret%C4%93">best way</a>
to organise diverse entities co-existing together in large dynamic groups? How
are such arrangements created? Who is responsible for making things work?</p>

<p>These are important questions in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy">political philosophy</a>
and
<a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">Internet</a> engineering and
show that both subjects, at an abstract level, share much in common.
From a political perspective the first question can be answered with
different forms of government, the second by investigating concepts like
justice, rights and law while the third question concerns the role of power
and authority. From a technological perspective the first question concerns
"architecture" (how computational resources fit together), the second is
answered by process, requirements and design while the third question concerns
capability, roles, standards and (again) authority.</p>

<p>This post concerns
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer to peer</a>
(P2P) architecture ~ where peers of
equal status (devices running appropriate software) cooperate in a loose
decentralised network for mutual benefit. Peer to peer is the antithesis of
hierarchy - where some have elevated status and power over others. The image
below illustrates how this changes the way devices connect and communicate. The
peer to peer network on the left is simply a collection of devices (in blue)
with different numbers of connections between them (in grey). The right hand
image is the classic client (blue) / server (red) hierarchy where many
clients rely on a single server to fulfil their functionality.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/topology.png" alt="p2p v client/server topology"/></p>

<p>Sometimes it is important to have hierarchy: it is best that a consultant
surgeon is in charge of an operation rather than a well-meaning democracy of
volunteers. In an ideal world, hierarchy is best when the obvious skill,
knowledge and capabilities of an entity are acknowledged to bring about
greater benefit for all. In an ideal world, those with elevated status and
authority would have earned it via reliable and consistent public displays of
such skill, knowledge and capabilities. In an ideal world, the responsibility
and trust associated with status and authority would be a serious yet welcome
obligation. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world and hierarchy is
often the cause of much that is bad and frustrating.</p>

<p>Some technologies, such as
<a href="/article/the-web-concise-and-simple">the web</a>,
are hierarchical and inadvertently introduce leverage points used to
exploit or gain power over users. The web has a <em>client/server</em>
architecture where information and the capabilities to change information
are firmly within the realm of the server (the website). The client, using a
browser, has to request the server deliver information <em>to them</em> and
make changes <em>for them</em>. Unfortunately, user's data is often stored and
delivered in a way that makes it hard to migrate between services. Personal
data is analyzed by websites and sold via targeted advertising or (worse)
handed to governments and other third parties without explicit consent.
Disruption ensues when websites break: there's no way to get important
documents if the server is down. The client/server model is centralisation of
power and websites are single points of failure.</p>

<p>Contrast the web with peer to peer architecture where the loose and
decentralised organisation of computing resources make it <em>very hard for
third parties to control</em> users. This simple idea can be illustrated
by two popular yet different peer to peer systems:
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">Bittorrent</a> (for sharing
large digital assets such as audio and video files) and
<a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> (a decentralised digital
currency).</p>

<p>For Bittorrent, Bitcoin and many other peer to peer systems the three
questions I asked at the start can be answered thus:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The most effective way to organise a diverse and dynamic group of
    participants is with peer to peer architecture (this can be for both
    technical and political reasons).</li>
    <li>The means of creating such a network is via an open protocol describing
    the expected behaviour of participants (including checks to ensure
    correctness).</li>
    <li>It is the participant's responsibility that they correctly implement
    the protocol in order to make the system function correctly.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bittorrent is an incredibly efficient way to share large files <em>because
of</em> its peer to peer architecture. Imagine that you wanted me to copy
a paper edition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace">War and Peace</a>.
I'd probably photocopy and give you every page in order. It's how
large files are usually downloaded: linearly from server to client.
Unfortunately, if I were busy or, worse still, had lost my
original you wouldn't get a copy. Bittorrent works differently: it's better if
I told you who else had a copy so you could ask them to provide <em>different
pieces</em> of the original that you then collated. This is faster because your
peers share the work concurrently. Furthermore, if one of the peers failed to
deliver their piece you'd notice it was missing and request it from another.
Therefore, there is no single point of failure. Finally, if someone else wanted
a copy then <em>you</em> could provide pieces even if you'd not yet received
the complete work. As a result peers <em>give as well as take</em> value from
the network.</p>

<p>In reality, users download a "torrent" file containing details of the
resource they're interested in and who to ask for it. They become a node on the
bittorrent network and request pieces from the identified peers. As
clients download and re-assemble the pieces of the file, others on the network
request pieces in turn. Thus, it takes a relatively short time
for large files to be delivered. Furthermore, popular files spread around the
network and become easier to deliver since there are more peers to provide
pieces.</p>

<p> Some websites (most famously the
<a href="http://thepiratebay.se/">PirateBay</a>) collect torrent files and
provide search facilities. Other sites, called "trackers", monitor which peers
have what files - although more recent versions of bittorrent
allow peers to do this themselves. The video below, made by the
creators of bittorrent, provides a good summary:</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NYTvTPrgSiM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The superior performance,
<a href="http://www.ipoque.com/sites/default/files/mediafiles/documents/internet-study-2008-2009.pdf">huge</a>
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/es/company/about/ces_2012_150m_users">number</a> of
<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1714001/bittorrent-has-more-users-netflix-and-hulu-combined-and-doubled">users</a>
and uncontrollable availability of pirated content
has led the incumbent "creative" industry to disrupt illegal sharing
through legal, economic and political means (for example, the PirateBay is
censored within the UK). This is
<a href="http://tpb.piraten.lu/">easier said than done</a> and in no way
changes the effectiveness of the Bittorrent network itself. Users quickly find
<a href="http://www.ichi.co.uk/post/22269260925/bypassing-the-uk-pirate-bay-blocks-via-proxies-mirrors">other means</a> of finding torrent files.</p>

<p>Bittorrent uses a peer to peer architecture because it is the best technical
solution. The legal, economic and political fallout emerged later. In contrast,
Bitcoin had political and economic motivations from the start and peer to peer
enables such ends.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency based upon an
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification">open protocol</a>.
Unlike regular currency, controlled by banks and governments, Bitcoin is
designed to have <em>no central issuing authority and instead relies on the
machinations of the protocol to regulate balances, transactions and the issuing
of currency</em>. Like cash, transactions can be anonymous. Bitcoins can be
subdivided into 100-million smaller units called "satoshis" and, at the time of
writing, one bitcoin is worth just over
<a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxGBP">&pound;8.82</a>.</p>

<p>Transactions reference Bitcoin addresses created by the potential recipient.
A Bitcoin user can have many Bitcoin addresses and may even decide to use one
address per transaction. They simply identify the recipient:</p>

<p><pre><code>1HcrwtLrbe97aRBD5KCn5izumXp8N7nXcS</code></pre></p>

<p>Sometimes they are displayed as QR-codes to be scanned by mobile
phones: </p>

<p><img src="/static/images/bitcoin-address.png" alt="A bitcoin address"/></p>

<p>Assuming a positive balance you can transfer bitcoins to me using the
Bitcoin address above (you can't have a negative Bitcoin balance). Your
Bitcoin software publishes and
<a href="/article/public-key-crypto-concise-and-simple">cryptographically
signs</a> the details of the transaction and peers check and verify the
details before adding it to a set of recent transactions called a "block".
Blocks are distributed around the network so balances and transfers
are tracked to avoid double spending. The protocol is designed so attackers
would need impossibly large amounts of time and computing power in order
to subvert the chain of blocks tracking transactions.</p>

<p>New Bitcoins are "discovered" by peers on the network as a reward for
solving the computationally hard problem that is part of the process for
creating new transaction blocks. The difficulty of the problem is adjusted by
the protocol to ensure that bitcoins are issued at a consistent rate. This
process is called "mining" and the supply of bitcoins will never exceed 21
million. When this limit is reached miner's efforts will be rewarded with a
small transaction fee. The video below explains Bitcoin from an end user's
perspective:</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Um63OQz3bjo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Bitcoin is complex and many details have been hidden in my explanation.
However, it is an open and audited technology and hundreds of thousands of
people trust it enough to use it every day.</p>

<p>Concerns have been raised about tax-avoidance, anonymous payment for illegal
goods and fraud via the use of Bitcoin but this also applies to traditional
currencies. Ultimately, the peer to peer nature of Bitcoin is the mechanism for
liberating users from the interference of banks and governments. It remains to
be seen if Bitcoin will become popular and disrupt the financial system in the
same way that Bittorrent has done with content delivery.</p>

<p>Peer to peer systems challenge the status-quo with a decentralising power
shift. Furthermore, creating such technology is far easier and more effective
than traditional means of political change.</p>

<h1><a href="/article/the-web-concise-and-simple">The World Wide Web ~ Concise and Simple</a></h1><p class="published_on">Friday 21st December 2012 (08:30PM)</p>

<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p>The World Wide Web (or just "the web") is a global hypertext
system invented by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Sir Tim
Berners-Lee</a> in 1989. The web is <strong>not</strong>
<a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">the Internet</a>. Rather, it
is an application that sends messages via the Internet. You're using it
now!</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/internet.png" alt="A map of the Internet"/></p>

<p>Hypertext is <em>the</em> core concept of the web: pages
containing text and other media reference each other via so-called
hyperlinks. In this way, pages connect to form a nebulous web of
relationships. Hypertext was coined in the 1960s by
<a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a> although the basic concept
dates back to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush's</a> 1945
article,
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true">As We May Think</a>
where he describes an intriguing device called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>
(MEMory indEX). Various pre-web hypertext systems were developed in the 1960s,
70s and 80s, but it was only until the early 1990s that Berners-Lee's version
of hypertext became popular.</p>

<p>The web is made with these concepts:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">Page</a> - a document
    on the web. Web pages can contain text, images, sound, video and forms
    (to facilitate limited interactivity).</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Hyperlink</a> -
    something in a page that, when activated, takes the user
    to another page on the web. Often abbreviated to "link".</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a> - a uniform
    resource location identifies a page or other resource on the web.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Browser</a> -
    software on the user's computer that downloads web pages, displays them
    and handles user interactions (such as filling in a form or clicking a
    link).</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">Server</a> -
    a device on the Internet that runs software to deliver web pages and other
    resources to browsers.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> - HyperText
    Transfer Protocol describes how browsers and servers interact.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> - HyperText
    Markup Language defines the structure of web pages identifying such things
    as paragraphs, links and headings.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>
    - Cascading Style Sheets describe how a page should look by defining
    layout, colour scheme, typesetting and other presentation information.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> -
    a ubiquitous programming language for browsers. It defines the behaviour
    of a page beyond the basics of clicking links or submitting forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the early days of the web HTML was the only way to create pages (CSS
and Javascript were later developments). The essence of HTML has not changed
over the years:</p>

<p>HTML is written as a series of <em>elements</em>. Elements are defined with
named <em>tags</em> between less-than (&lt;) and greater-than
(&gt;) symbols. The scope of an element is defined by an opening and
closing tag. For example, a heading is defined by the
<code>h1</code> element:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>The closing tag is just like the opening one apart from the prepended
back-slash (/). The tags are a balanced pair: the scope
of the heading element is defined as the text "Hello" and displayed as:</p>

<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>Elements can contain other elements but are not allowed to overlap:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>but,</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>HTML has a certain structure: two elements, <code>head</code> and
<code>body</code>, are contained within an <code>html</code> element.
Information about the document is expressed by elements within the
<code>head</code> tags. Elements within the <code>body</code>
tags define the structure of the page. For example:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css"/&gt;
    &lt;meta name="author" content="Nicholas H.Tollervey"/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is some text enclosed within a paragraph tag.
    I can link to &lt;a href="http://ntoll.org/"&gt;other docs&lt;/a&gt;
    using an anchor tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>HTML is currently at version five (HTML5). Actually, HTML5 is
a collection of standards. Some add capabilities for embedding media while
others add new tags. HTML5 colloquially refers to specifications for new
browser behaviour too, such as local data storage.</p>

<p>Browsers were originally simple and merely text based applications, as
shown in the screenshot below. Despite these shortcomings the structure of the
page is very clear and easy to read (hyperlinks are green).</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/lynx.png" alt="Old skool web"/></p>

<p>The web "happens" in two places: the client's browser and the website's
server.</p>

<p>Clicking a link or typing in a URL makes your browser send a request
over the Internet using HTTP (as
<a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">described here</a>).
The server identified within the URL responds with HTML for the web page, CSS
describing how to display it and any Javascript needed for the page to function
correctly.</p>

<p>Before rendering the page to the screen the browser transforms the HTML
in to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">document object
model</a> (DOM). The DOM is a data structure used to match HTML elements
with CSS rules. Furthermore, snippets of Javascript run at certain points
in the page's existence and manipulate the DOM as events occur (such
as when the page finishes loading, a button is clicked or a form is
submitted).</p>

<p>As you interact with the browser it repeats this process to fetch new pages
from the websites you visit. Sometimes your browser <em>posts</em> information
back to a website (when you fill in a form). The website responds
with a page that reflects the information you submitted.</p>

<p>This happens within the realm of your "client" computer. However, an
equally interesting story happens on the server.</p>

<p>In the simplest case web pages are static so the server responds with
pre-existing content. However, many websites are dynamic and allow you to
change them on-the-fly. For example, as you browse a shopping website you may
click buttons that add items to a virtual shopping basket. If you visit the
web page that represents your basket you expect it to be up-to-date and list
the correct number of items.</p>

<p>For this to happen several things must be in place.</p>

<p><em>The server should know who you are</em>. You are authenticated in
some way, usually with a username and secret password, and authorised to
interact with certain pages. For example, only you should be able to view and
change your settings. Furthermore, the server must not confuse you with other
users, so your interaction with the website is associated with a unique
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)">session</a>
linked to your identity so the server can track who is making requests.</p>

<p><em>The server should keep track of state</em>. When you add an item to a
shopping cart this should be reflected in the way the website behaves. Such
state is stored in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> "backend".</p>

<p><em>The HTML should reflect the state stored in the database</em>. This is
achieved with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor">templates</a>:
snippets of HTML combined with data specific to the client.
Rendering templates to HTML is "frontend".
The following snippet is for a simple shopping basket (anything enclosed
within <code>{% raw %}{% %}{% endraw %}</code> is replaced):</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">{% raw %}&lt;h1&gt;Hi, {% user.username %}!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your shopping cart contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{% for item in user.cart %}
  &lt;li&gt;{{item.name}} - {{item.description}}&lt;/li&gt;
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre></p>

<p><em>The server should be reliable</em>. Between the front and back ends
is a <em>logic</em> layer checking requests, interacting
with the database and ensuring the correct HTML is served. This needs to work
correctly (imagine if, when clicking a "buy this item" button, a
website added two items rather than one).</p>

<p><em>The server should perform well</em>. A website should quickly
handle a great many requests at once. Two common ways to achieve good
performance are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">caching</a> (store
and re-use things that take time to compute but don't change that much over
time) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)">load
balancing</a> (route incoming calls to a pool of servers so the
workload is shared). Popular websites consist of many servers
handling specific tasks (such as the database, rendering templates or
the logic) hidden behind layers of load balancers and caches.</p>

<p>If this sounds complicated, that's because it is. However, the description
given above is a simplification of the amazing engineering that takes place
to display a web page on your screen.</p>

<p>However, all is not well.</p>

<p>Browsers implement web-standards in different ways:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>
is famous for getting things wrong. HTML and CSS are more complex
with each revision - gone are the days of a beautifully simple hypertext
system. Competing technical standards are promoted for commercial rather than
engineering reasons and some are so complex they're practically useless. Alas,
Javascript is <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">hopelessly
unintuitive</a> and provides developers with plenty of rope with which to hang
themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, there are political problems.</p>

<p>You can't publish on the web unless you know how to
set up a website or you use a third party service such as a social
network. Social networks are hugely popular but turn the
web into a handful of walled gardens - the antithesis of the decentralised
early web. Furthermore, such websites track and analyse user
behaviour and sell it (via advertising). They also provide services for
storing user's digital assets (in order to harvest yet more data to
sell). As has been
<a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security/">pointed out
before</a>, this is deeply worrying.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is a question of who controls the infrastructure.
Many users are happy to sacrifice privacy and control for ease of use and
convenience. Yet I wonder how many realise that they are tracked and
influenced by only a handful of very powerful technology companies.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/infrastructures.png" alt="Infrastructure"/></p>

<p>What of the future? I like to think that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a> was
right when, in 1996
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm">he said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>[T]he World Wide Web [is] the test pattern for whatever will become the dominant global medium.</blockquote>

<p>(Who knows what will happen next?)</p>

<h1><a href="/article/public-key-crypto-concise-and-simple">Public Key Cryptography ~ Concise and Simple</a></h1><p class="published_on">Wednesday 12th December 2012 (08:30AM)</p>

<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p>Sometimes people need privacy: intimate declarations of love, doctors
discussing a patient, engineers developing a new top secret world changing
product and journalists planning an expos&eacute; of government
corruption are just a few scenarios where privacy is both a reasonable and
legitimate requirement.</p>

<p>This need extends to our digital lives. For example, sensitive credit card
information is privately shared to complete on-line purchases. Furthermore,
<em>you</em> may be that lover, doctor, engineer or political journalist in
need of private communication via the Internet. Maybe you simply don't like
the idea of others reading your personal digital communications.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key
cryptography</a> is probably the most widespread solution to ensure
privacy on-line. This article briefly explains what it is and how it works
before concentrating on its uses.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">Cryptography</a> is
the study and application of techniques that secure
communication in the presence of third parties (some of whom may wish to
eavesdrop). It is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#List_of_characters">
traditional</a> to identify the various parties involved in a cryptographic
communication as Alice (the sender), Bob (the recipient) and Eve (the
[sometimes nefarious] eavesdropper). In the specific case of communications
sent via <a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">the Internet</a>,
messages may be handled by a large number of intermediary devices en-route to
their destination. Any of these intermediaries may read the content of the
message; in fact, they may need to in order to correctly route it to the
intended recipient. To put it another way, the Internet is a public broadcast
mechanism and its constituent devices are all Eve.</p>

<img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/alice_and_bob.png" alt="Eve explains why she's interested in Alice and Bob's communication."/>

<p>To overcome this problem, the meaningful content of messages (usually called
the plaintext) is encrypted (in to something called the ciphertext) before
being sent via the Internet. Such content appears as gobbledegook to
devices handling the message on its journey to the recipient. Once
received the recipient decrypts the ciphertext to retrieve the original
meaningful plaintext message.</p>

<p>The process of encryption and decryption is done by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">cipher</a> -
instructions that explain how to transform plaintext into ciphertext. An
additional secret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)">key</a>, known only
to the sender and recipients, is also used by the cipher to ensure only those
with the key can read such communication.<p>

<p>Within a computing context the plaintext, ciphertext and key are all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital">digital</a> assets - things
that are ultimately represented by binary values. In
other words, such assets are merely very large numbers. Therefore, the cipher
is only a mathematical function. It encrypts by using the key (a number) to
turn the plaintext (a number) into the ciphertext (also a number). Decryption
is similar in that it uses the key to turn the ciphertext into the original
plaintext.</p>

<p>For cryptography to work both sender and receiver[s] must share information
about the cipher and key to be used for secure communication. This presents a
problem: how should Alice and Bob share such fundamental information? Any
communication between them at this stage is insecure because they are yet to
share and agree upon the cryptographic means for secure communication.
Furthermore, Eve may be listening in to intercept such details and could use
what she learns to listen in on the supposed secure communication. Alice and Bob
find themselves in a crypto-chicken-and-egg situation.</p>

<p>This is where public key cryptography provides an elegant solution. Rather
than use a single key, participants have two: a public key that they
share with the whole world and a private key that they keep for themselves.
Because of the mathematical relationship between the two keys it is only
possible to decrypt a ciphertext with the <em>other</em> key in the pair. If
Alice wants to send information to Bob she uses Bob's <em>public</em> key to
encrypt her message and sends the resulting ciphertext. Importantly, only Bob
can decrypt the message since only his <em>private</em> key can turn the
ciphertext into plaintext. Eve can observe the complete exchange without
gaining the information she needs to decrypt the message from Alice to Bob
because Bob's private key is never transmitted.</p>

<p>Public key cryptography (specifically the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)">RSA</a> algorithm) is
thought secure because it depends upon integer factorization - the process of
decomposing a number into its constituent prime-number divisors. In other
words, every whole number is the result of multiplying a unique set
of prime numbers together. For example, to get the number 12
use 2&times;2&times;3. As the number gets larger finding the constituent
prime numbers becomes too hard to be solved in a realistic amount of time.
Public key cryptography uses two huge prime numbers that result in
<em><code>n</code></em>, an even longer number whose length is measured in
"bits" (the longer the better) and whose value is used by the cipher.
Currently, <em><code>n</code></em> of 2048 bits length is considered secure
given currently available computing power (i.e. given a huge amount of
computing power it would still take an inordinate amount of time to crack).</p>

<p>In terms of the modus operandi of public key cryptography, that's about all
you need to know without going in to technical details. There are many
excellent explanations of how public key cryptography works "under to hood" and
constraints of space stop me from going in to more detail. However, the video
embedded below provides an engaging and comprehensive explanation and is part
of the excellent series

Secrets</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtOfTheProblem">Art of
the Problem</a>.</p>

<p>An interesting side effect of public key cryptography is that it can be
used to "sign" digital assets to prove provenance or identity. Given that any
digital asset is simply a large number it is possible to use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash function</a> - a
means of mapping variable length numbers to relatively small, fixed
length numbers - to create a unique "signature" that can be cryptographically
verified. Consider the following
snippet of Python code (don't worry if you can't program, it's easy to
follow):</p>

<p><pre><code class="python">from hashlib import sha1
my_digital_asset = open('war-and-peace.txt').read()
hash = sha1(my_digital_asset)
print int(hash.hexdigest().encode('hex'), 16)
</code></pre></p>

<p>This simply loads the complete text of
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600.txt">War and Peace</a>
and uses a hashing
algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1</a> to
generate the <code>hash</code> that is printed on the screen as an
integer (whole number). The resulting hash for War and Peace is the number:</p>

<p><code>435515005527869578462696388723361351836071321997289162047109517397984640443675003720894549210723</code></p>

<p>Alice encodes this number with her private key
and sends the resulting signature to Bob. Bob uses Alice's <em>public</em> key
to
decrypt the signature and retrieve the hash we generated above. Then <em>he</em>
attempts to create <em>his own hash</em> of the complete text of War and
Peace. If
his hash matches Alice's he knows that both he and Alice are referencing the
<em>same</em> digital asset. If the text for War and Peace had only one letter
changed (either by mistake or because someone was tampering with it) then the
hashes would have been different. As Bob knows only Alice has access to
her private key, and only Alice's <em>public key</em> can decrypt such
a signature then he can trust the provenance of the digital asset "signed"
by Alice since only she could have created such a signature with her
private key. In this way, Alice can also cryptographically sign her own
messages to Bob.</p>

<p>It is important to acknowledge the political aspect of public key
cryptography. Politicians, the Police and security services complain that
terrorists and criminals use strong cryptography to hide
their illegal activities. Laws such as the U.K.'s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000">RIPA</a>
give the government and other public authorities (such as the Police or local
council) powers to force you to hand over your private keys. When challenged
about this curtailment of civil liberties (see article 12 of the UN's
<a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human
Rights</a>) a common response is, "if you have nothing to hide, you have
nothing to fear". This is, of course, a dangerous attitude: the authorities get
to decide what "nothing to hide" means and this changes all the time. For
example, since the introduction of RIPA the list of authorities empowered by
the act has increased four times (in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010). How would you
feel if the recording industry became an authority and insisted you hand over
keys so they can check your audio collection?</p>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian">Orwellian</a> prospect
if ever there was one.</p>

<p>Finally, development of such cryptographic technology is usually done in
public by experts. It is open and public because problems and bugs are spotted
quicker. Furthermore, designing and implementing cryptographic systems
requires significant domain expertise. This convention ensures there are
always freely available, well tested and well designed cryptographic libraries
for non-expert programmers to re-use in their projects.</p>

<p>The challenge for programmers and cryptographers is to make the use of
strong encryption the norm. It is ubiquitous for on-line financial transactions
but most other things (email, web browsing, chat and other such digital
interactions) are usually <em>not</em> secured. I suspect this will remain the
case until people realise that their on-line life is currently like living in a
house with no curtains.</p>
