<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p>The World Wide Web (or just "the web") is a global hypertext
system invented by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Sir Tim
Berners-Lee</a> in 1989. The web is <strong>not</strong>
<a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">the Internet</a>. Rather, it
is an application that sends messages via the Internet. You're using it
now!</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/internet.png" alt="A map of the Internet"/></p>

<p>Hypertext is <em>the</em> core concept of the web: pages
containing text and other media reference each other via so-called
hyperlinks. In this way, pages connect to form a nebulous web of
relationships. Hypertext was coined in the 1960s by
<a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a> although the basic concept
dates back to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush's</a> 1945
article,
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true">As We May Think</a>
where he describes an intriguing device called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>
(MEMory indEX). Various pre-web hypertext systems were developed in the 1960s,
70s and 80s, but it was only until the early 1990s that Berners-Lee's version
of hypertext became popular.</p>

<p>The web is made with these concepts:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">Page</a> - a document
    on the web. Web pages can contain text, images, sound, video and forms
    (to facilitate limited interactivity).</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Hyperlink</a> -
    something in a page that, when activated, takes the user
    to another page on the web. Often abbreviated to "link".</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a> - a uniform
    resource location identifies a page or other resource on the web.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Browser</a> -
    software on the user's computer that downloads web pages, displays them
    and handles user interactions (such as filling in a form or clicking a
    link).</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">Server</a> -
    a device on the Internet that runs software to deliver web pages and other
    resources to browsers.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> - HyperText
    Transfer Protocol describes how browsers and servers interact.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> - HyperText
    Markup Language defines the structure of web pages identifying such things
    as paragraphs, links and headings.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>
    - Cascading Style Sheets describe how a page should look by defining
    layout, colour scheme, typesetting and other presentation information.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> -
    a ubiquitous programming language for browsers. It defines the behaviour
    of a page beyond the basics of clicking links or submitting forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the early days of the web HTML was the only way to create pages (CSS
and Javascript were later developments). The essence of HTML has not changed
over the years:</p>

<p>HTML is written as a series of <em>elements</em>. Elements are defined with
named <em>tags</em> between less-than (&lt;) and greater-than
(&gt;) symbols. The scope of an element is defined by an opening and
closing tag. For example, a heading is defined by the
<code>h1</code> element:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>The closing tag is just like the opening one apart from the prepended
back-slash (/). The tags are a balanced pair: the scope
of the heading element is defined as the text "Hello" and displayed as:</p>

<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>Elements can contain other elements but are not allowed to overlap:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>but,</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>HTML has a certain structure: two elements, <code>head</code> and
<code>body</code>, are contained within an <code>html</code> element.
Information about the document is expressed by elements within the
<code>head</code> tags. Elements within the <code>body</code>
tags define the structure of the page. For example:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css"/&gt;
    &lt;meta name="author" content="Nicholas H.Tollervey"/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is some text enclosed within a paragraph tag.
    I can link to &lt;a href="http://ntoll.org/"&gt;other docs&lt;/a&gt;
    using an anchor tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>HTML is currently at version five (HTML5). Actually, HTML5 is
a collection of standards. Some add capabilities for embedding media while
others add new tags. HTML5 colloquially refers to specifications for new
browser behaviour too, such as local data storage.</p>

<p>Browsers were originally simple and merely text based applications, as
shown in the screenshot below. Despite these shortcomings the structure of the
page is very clear and easy to read (hyperlinks are green).</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/lynx.png" alt="Old skool web"/></p>

<p>The web "happens" in two places: the client's browser and the website's
server.</p>

<p>Clicking a link or typing in a URL makes your browser send a request
over the Internet using HTTP (as
<a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">described here</a>).
The server identified within the URL responds with HTML for the web page, CSS
describing how to display it and any Javascript needed for the page to function
correctly.</p>

<p>Before rendering the page to the screen the browser transforms the HTML
in to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">document object
model</a> (DOM). The DOM is a data structure used to match HTML elements
with CSS rules. Furthermore, snippets of Javascript run at certain points
in the page's existence and manipulate the DOM as events occur (such
as when the page finishes loading, a button is clicked or a form is
submitted).</p>

<p>As you interact with the browser it repeats this process to fetch new pages
from the websites you visit. Sometimes your browser <em>posts</em> information
back to a website (when you fill in a form). The website responds
with a page that reflects the information you submitted.</p>

<p>This happens within the realm of your "client" computer. However, an
equally interesting story happens on the server.</p>

<p>In the simplest case web pages are static so the server responds with
pre-existing content. However, many websites are dynamic and allow you to
change them on-the-fly. For example, as you browse a shopping website you may
click buttons that add items to a virtual shopping basket. If you visit the
web page that represents your basket you expect it to be up-to-date and list
the correct number of items.</p>

<p>For this to happen several things must be in place.</p>

<p><em>The server should know who you are</em>. You are authenticated in
some way, usually with a username and secret password, and authorised to
interact with certain pages. For example, only you should be able to view and
change your settings. Furthermore, the server must not confuse you with other
users, so your interaction with the website is associated with a unique
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)">session</a>
linked to your identity so the server can track who is making requests.</p>

<p><em>The server should keep track of state</em>. When you add an item to a
shopping cart this should be reflected in the way the website behaves. Such
state is stored in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> "backend".</p>

<p><em>The HTML should reflect the state stored in the database</em>. This is
achieved with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor">templates</a>:
snippets of HTML combined with data specific to the client.
Rendering templates to HTML is "frontend".
The following snippet is for a simple shopping basket (anything enclosed
within <code>{% raw %}{% %}{% endraw %}</code> is replaced):</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">{% raw %}&lt;h1&gt;Hi, {% user.username %}!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your shopping cart contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{% for item in user.cart %}
  &lt;li&gt;{{item.name}} - {{item.description}}&lt;/li&gt;
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre></p>

<p><em>The server should be reliable</em>. Between the front and back ends
is a <em>logic</em> layer checking requests, interacting
with the database and ensuring the correct HTML is served. This needs to work
correctly (imagine if, when clicking a "buy this item" button, a
website added two items rather than one).</p>

<p><em>The server should perform well</em>. A website should quickly
handle a great many requests at once. Two common ways to achieve good
performance are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">caching</a> (store
and re-use things that take time to compute but don't change that much over
time) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)">load
balancing</a> (route incoming calls to a pool of servers so the
workload is shared). Popular websites consist of many servers
handling specific tasks (such as the database, rendering templates or
the logic) hidden behind layers of load balancers and caches.</p>

<p>If this sounds complicated, that's because it is. However, the description
given above is a simplification of the amazing engineering that takes place
to display a web page on your screen.</p>

<p>However, all is not well.</p>

<p>Browsers implement web-standards in different ways:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>
is famous for getting things wrong. HTML and CSS are more complex
with each revision - gone are the days of a beautifully simple hypertext
system. Competing technical standards are promoted for commercial rather than
engineering reasons and some are so complex they're practically useless. Alas,
Javascript is <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">hopelessly
unintuitive</a> and provides developers with plenty of rope with which to hang
themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, there are political problems.</p>

<p>You can't publish on the web unless you know how to
set up a website or you use a third party service such as a social
network. Social networks are hugely popular but turn the
web into a handful of walled gardens - the antithesis of the decentralised
early web. Furthermore, such websites track and analyse user
behaviour and sell it (via advertising). They also provide services for
storing user's digital assets (in order to harvest yet more data to
sell). As has been
<a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security/">pointed out
before</a>, this is deeply worrying.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is a question of who controls the infrastructure.
Many users are happy to sacrifice privacy and control for ease of use and
convenience. Yet I wonder how many realise that they are tracked and
influenced by only a handful of very powerful technology companies.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/infrastructures.png" alt="Infrastructure"/></p>

<p>What of the future? I like to think that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a> was
right when, in 1996
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm">he said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>[T]he World Wide Web [is] the test pattern for whatever will become the dominant global medium.</blockquote>

<p>(Who knows what will happen next?)</p>

        <title>Public Key Cryptography ~ Concise and Simple</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/public-key-crypto-concise-and-simple</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/public-key-crypto-concise-and-simple">Public Key Cryptography ~ Concise and Simple</a></h1><p class="published_on">Wednesday 12th December 2012 (08:30AM)</p>

<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p>Sometimes people need privacy: intimate declarations of love, doctors
discussing a patient, engineers developing a new top secret world changing
product and journalists planning an expos&eacute; of government
corruption are just a few scenarios where privacy is both a reasonable and
legitimate requirement.</p>

<p>This need extends to our digital lives. For example, sensitive credit card
information is privately shared to complete on-line purchases. Furthermore,
<em>you</em> may be that lover, doctor, engineer or political journalist in
need of private communication via the Internet. Maybe you simply don't like
the idea of others reading your personal digital communications.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key
cryptography</a> is probably the most widespread solution to ensure
privacy on-line. This article briefly explains what it is and how it works
before concentrating on its uses.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">Cryptography</a> is
the study and application of techniques that secure
communication in the presence of third parties (some of whom may wish to
eavesdrop). It is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#List_of_characters">
traditional</a> to identify the various parties involved in a cryptographic
communication as Alice (the sender), Bob (the recipient) and Eve (the
[sometimes nefarious] eavesdropper). In the specific case of communications
sent via <a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">the Internet</a>,
messages may be handled by a large number of intermediary devices en-route to
their destination. Any of these intermediaries may read the content of the
message; in fact, they may need to in order to correctly route it to the
intended recipient. To put it another way, the Internet is a public broadcast
mechanism and its constituent devices are all Eve.</p>

<img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/alice_and_bob.png" alt="Eve explains why she's interested in Alice and Bob's communication."/>

<p>To overcome this problem, the meaningful content of messages (usually called
the plaintext) is encrypted (in to something called the ciphertext) before
being sent via the Internet. Such content appears as gobbledegook to
devices handling the message on its journey to the recipient. Once
received the recipient decrypts the ciphertext to retrieve the original
meaningful plaintext message.</p>

<p>The process of encryption and decryption is done by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">cipher</a> -
instructions that explain how to transform plaintext into ciphertext. An
additional secret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)">key</a>, known only
to the sender and recipients, is also used by the cipher to ensure only those
with the key can read such communication.<p>

<p>Within a computing context the plaintext, ciphertext and key are all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital">digital</a> assets - things
that are ultimately represented by binary values. In
other words, such assets are merely very large numbers. Therefore, the cipher
is only a mathematical function. It encrypts by using the key (a number) to
turn the plaintext (a number) into the ciphertext (also a number). Decryption
is similar in that it uses the key to turn the ciphertext into the original
plaintext.</p>

<p>For cryptography to work both sender and receiver[s] must share information
about the cipher and key to be used for secure communication. This presents a
problem: how should Alice and Bob share such fundamental information? Any
communication between them at this stage is insecure because they are yet to
share and agree upon the cryptographic means for secure communication.
Furthermore, Eve may be listening in to intercept such details and could use
what she learns to listen in on the supposed secure communication. Alice and Bob
find themselves in a crypto-chicken-and-egg situation.</p>

<p>This is where public key cryptography provides an elegant solution. Rather
than use a single key, participants have two: a public key that they
share with the whole world and a private key that they keep for themselves.
Because of the mathematical relationship between the two keys it is only
possible to decrypt a ciphertext with the <em>other</em> key in the pair. If
Alice wants to send information to Bob she uses Bob's <em>public</em> key to
encrypt her message and sends the resulting ciphertext. Importantly, only Bob
can decrypt the message since only his <em>private</em> key can turn the
ciphertext into plaintext. Eve can observe the complete exchange without
gaining the information she needs to decrypt the message from Alice to Bob
because Bob's private key is never transmitted.</p>

<p>Public key cryptography (specifically the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)">RSA</a> algorithm) is
thought secure because it depends upon integer factorization - the process of
decomposing a number into its constituent prime-number divisors. In other
words, every whole number is the result of multiplying a unique set
of prime numbers together. For example, to get the number 12
use 2&times;2&times;3. As the number gets larger finding the constituent
prime numbers becomes too hard to be solved in a realistic amount of time.
Public key cryptography uses two huge prime numbers that result in
<em><code>n</code></em>, an even longer number whose length is measured in
"bits" (the longer the better) and whose value is used by the cipher.
Currently, <em><code>n</code></em> of 2048 bits length is considered secure
given currently available computing power (i.e. given a huge amount of
computing power it would still take an inordinate amount of time to crack).</p>

<p>In terms of the modus operandi of public key cryptography, that's about all
you need to know without going in to technical details. There are many
excellent explanations of how public key cryptography works "under to hood" and
constraints of space stop me from going in to more detail. However, the video
embedded below provides an engaging and comprehensive explanation and is part
of the excellent series
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/course?list=ECB4D701646DAF0817">Gambling with
Secrets</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtOfTheProblem">Art of
the Problem</a>.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vgTtHV04xRI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>An interesting side effect of public key cryptography is that it can be
used to "sign" digital assets to prove provenance or identity. Given that any
digital asset is simply a large number it is possible to use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash function</a> - a
means of mapping variable length numbers to relatively small, fixed
length numbers - to create a unique "signature" that can be cryptographically
verified. Consider the following
snippet of Python code (don't worry if you can't program, it's easy to
follow):</p>

<p><pre><code class="python">from hashlib import sha1
my_digital_asset = open('war-and-peace.txt').read()
hash = sha1(my_digital_asset)
print int(hash.hexdigest().encode('hex'), 16)
</code></pre></p>

<p>This simply loads the complete text of
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600.txt">War and Peace</a>
and uses a hashing
algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1</a> to
generate the <code>hash</code> that is printed on the screen as an
integer (whole number). The resulting hash for War and Peace is the number:</p>

<p><code>435515005527869578462696388723361351836071321997289162047109517397984640443675003720894549210723</code></p>

<p>Alice encodes this number with her private key
and sends the resulting signature to Bob. Bob uses Alice's <em>public</em> key
to
decrypt the signature and retrieve the hash we generated above. Then <em>he</em>
attempts to create <em>his own hash</em> of the complete text of War and
Peace. If
his hash matches Alice's he knows that both he and Alice are referencing the
<em>same</em> digital asset. If the text for War and Peace had only one letter
changed (either by mistake or because someone was tampering with it) then the
hashes would have been different. As Bob knows only Alice has access to
her private key, and only Alice's <em>public key</em> can decrypt such
a signature then he can trust the provenance of the digital asset "signed"
by Alice since only she could have created such a signature with her
private key. In this way, Alice can also cryptographically sign her own
messages to Bob.</p>

<p>It is important to acknowledge the political aspect of public key
cryptography. Politicians, the Police and security services complain that
terrorists and criminals use strong cryptography to hide
their illegal activities. Laws such as the U.K.'s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000">RIPA</a>
give the government and other public authorities (such as the Police or local
council) powers to force you to hand over your private keys. When challenged
about this curtailment of civil liberties (see article 12 of the UN's
<a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human
Rights</a>) a common response is, "if you have nothing to hide, you have
nothing to fear". This is, of course, a dangerous attitude: the authorities get
to decide what "nothing to hide" means and this changes all the time. For
example, since the introduction of RIPA the list of authorities empowered by
the act has increased four times (in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010). How would you
feel if the recording industry became an authority and insisted you hand over
keys so they can check your audio collection?</p>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian">Orwellian</a> prospect
if ever there was one.</p>

<p>Finally, development of such cryptographic technology is usually done in
public by experts. It is open and public because problems and bugs are spotted
quicker. Furthermore, designing and implementing cryptographic systems
requires significant domain expertise. This convention ensures there are
always freely available, well tested and well designed cryptographic libraries
for non-expert programmers to re-use in their projects.</p>

<p>The challenge for programmers and cryptographers is to make the use of
strong encryption the norm. It is ubiquitous for on-line financial transactions
but most other things (email, web browsing, chat and other such digital
interactions) are usually <em>not</em> secured. I suspect this will remain the
case until people realise that their on-line life is currently like living in a
house with no curtains.</p>

        <title>The Internet ~ Concise and Simple</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/internet-concise-and-simple</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">The Internet ~ Concise and Simple</a></h1><p class="published_on">Tuesday 4th December 2012 (08:30AM)</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what makes it possible to serve web pages like this
one, deliver an email or join a video conference, all seemingly in an
instant? The answer is the Internet, a decentralised global network of
computers. This article explains what's involved.</p>

<p>Devices on the Internet communicate using different yet related protocols.
A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that explain how to communicate
information. For example, although nothing to do with the Internet, Morse code
is a sort of communication protocol.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickz/2207171580/">
    <img src="/static/images/strata.jpg" alt="Strata - Coyote Buttes, Arizona"/>
</a>

<p>For the Internet to work, protocols are layered: each layer
provides specific functionality needed to make the complete strata of layers
work as a whole. Layers depend upon each other with lower levels
providing services for the layers above.</p>

<p>At the very lowest layer are protocols concerning how information is
physically sent from one device to another. At the very highest layer are
protocols for information sharing systems such as the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web</a> (WWW or just the "Web"),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email">Email</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay
Chat</a> (IRC) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">Voice
Over IP</a> to name but a few.</p>

<p>These layers have been formalised by the
<a href="http://www.iso.org/">ISO</a> (International Standards Organisation)
as the
<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=20269">Open Systems Interconnection</a>
model. It has seven layers:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <em>physical layer</em> describes the physical characteristics of
    communication. For example, protocols at this level specify
    voltages, layout of plugs and sockets, radio frequencies and so on
    depending on the physical medium of communication. A helpful transport
    based analogy is that it's like describing roads as being made of asphalt,
    traffic lights as having three colours and certain markings being painted
    where roads intersect.</li>

    <li>The <em>data link layer</em> concerns the transfer of information
    between neighbouring nodes in a network. Some protocols at this level
    detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.
    To continue the transport analogy, this layer is the traffic
    officer controlling and directing the flow of traffic between adjacent
    neighbourhoods or the practice of stopping at red traffic lights and
    understanding who has right of way at a roundabout.</li>

    <li>The <em>network layer</em> contains protocols that describe how
    information should be routed across a network including descriptions of
    how messages should be forwarded to their intended
    recipient. Its function is similar to that of a navigator reading a map and
    listening to traffic reports in order to find the route for a long car
    journey.</li>

    <li>The <em>transport layer</em> gives the impression of linking places on
    the network for a (usually reliable) exchange of information. This may
    include error detection and correction, flow control (how much information
    is sent at a time) and segmentation (how messages are split up in to
    their constituent parts and re-assembled at the receiving end). This is
    like being able to send letters: your post box and the recipient's letter
    box are connected together through the workings of the Post Office (the
    transport layer).</li>

    <li>The <em>session layer</em> defines how communication is opened, closed
    and managed between devices communicating over the network. For example,
    if an open line of communication between two devices is interrupted then
    the protocols in this layer will attempt to reconnect. The
    concept of "letter" would be defined in this layer along with conventions
    such as starting letters with "Dear So-and-so".</li>

    <li>The <em>presentation layer</em> translates raw data in to something
    that can be sent over the network. This may include serialising
    complex data structures into strings of characters or describing the
    characteristics of the message, such as its total size. It is often at
    this level that encryption takes place in order to secure communications.
    This layer is analogous to writing a letter on a piece of paper and
    putting it in an envelope with an address and stamp on the front.</li>

    <li>The <em>application layer</em> involves creating and consuming
    messages needed for applications that work via the Internet. This includes
    generating and checking data fields or ensuring the correct
    structure of the message. This is, perhaps, similar to filling in a tax
    return with the required information before posting it back to the revenue
    collector (where the "application" is collection of taxes).</li>
</ol>

<p>Layers are not the end of the story. Messages are split in to chunks
of data, sent over the network and then reassembled at the recipient. Each
protocol has a different name for such chunks of data: for example, at the
data link layer they are called "frames", at the network layer "packets" and at
the transport layer they are called "segments" or "datagrams". Chunks of data
from higher level protocols are wrapped within those of the lower levels.</p>

<p>Data chunks contain two types of information: control information and the
payload (containing data from the higher level protocols). Control information
is used by the protocol to fulfil its function while the payload is handed over
to the next protocol up in the layers described above.</p>

<p>Furthermore, each connected device needs to have a unique address so it can
be found on the network. These are unique numbers called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addresses</a>
implemented in the network layer, most commonly by the Internet Protocol (IP)
- hence the name.</p>

<p>Blocks of numbers are assigned to different "entities" (governments,
educational institutions, organisations and companies) by the
<a href="http://www.iana.org/">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a> (IANA).
Such entities further assign sub-blocks until we arrive at a single IP address
assigned to an individual device on the network.</p>

<p>IP addresses generally come in two types reflecting the version of IP that
they correspond to:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>. The maximum number of
IPv4 addresses is 4,294,967,296. While this may sound like a lot of potential
addresses I'm afraid we've already run out. As a result
IPv6 caters for a huge number of addresses:
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 (that's 2<sup>128</sup>).
The Internet is currently transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6.</p>

<p>Because humans are no good at remembering long numbers we
refer to devices connected to the Internet with human-friendly domain names
such as <a href="http://bbc.co.uk">bbc.co.uk</a>. Whenever we make a request
to a domain we must use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name
System</a> (DNS) to map the domain name to the IP address of
the correct device on the Internet (so, looking up the bbc.co.uk domain gives
an IP address of a device owned by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a>). DNS is a distributed
lookup service that is organised and run by domain name registrars (with whom
you register your ownership of a domain) and policed, via laws and
legal interventions, by governments and business interests (such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America">RIAA</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Phonographic_Industry">BPI</a>).</p>

<p>However, any single device may be running several different
networked applications at the same time (for example, an email client, a web
server or a chat service). Numbered
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_port">ports</a> on a connected
device function in a similar way to numbered mail boxes in a block of flats:
applications know to "listen" on specific port numbers for only their messages.
Standards dictate how certain port numbers map to particular application
protocols. For example, unencrypted requests on the web get sent to port 80.</p>

<p>It is because of the existence of ports that there are many more
devices connected to the Internet than there are IPv4 addresses. The Internet
is, in fact, a collection of many local networks. Within each local network
devices are assigned unique IP addresses <em>but</em> the device that is
connected to the wider Internet (called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">router</a>) only
has a single external
IP address. How can the router's single IP address be shared by all
the devices on the local network?</p>

<p>The answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT">Network Address
Translation</a> (NAT) - the router maps an
external and unused port to an internal (local) device. For example, all
requests to the router on port something-or-other could be simply forwarded to
the device on the local network identified by a locally unique (internal) IP
address.</p>

<p>Finally, network traffic is policed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">firewalls</a>
using techniques such as IP address blocking. A firewall is like a border
control checkpoint: every chunk of data is examined and either discarded or
allowed to pass depending on a set of rules. IP address blocking is a specific
example of a firewall rule: blacklist any traffic to or from a specific block
of IP addresses (such as those from outside China).</p>

<p>Some firewalls are sophisticated enough to do
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet
inspection</a> where the content of network traffic is examined for
the purposes of security, data mining, eavesdropping or censorship. Chunks that
are deemed bad are not allowed through. Encrypting messages at the higher
levels of the Internet stack go some way to circumventing such measures
although traffic analysis (an examination of network behaviour) can be used to
infer the intent of a message.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the details of specific protocols can't be explored in such
a short introductory essay. However, if you're interested in finding out more
you should investigate the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF)
database of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html">Requests for Comment</a>
(RFC) used to define the various protocols.</p>

<p>And remember, most of the above appears to happen instantaneously
to connect computers that could be on opposite sides of the planet -
something that fills me with amazement.</p>
