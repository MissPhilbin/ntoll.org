        <title>Teachers and Students at PyconUK 2013</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/education-at-pyconuk2013</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/education-at-pyconuk2013">Teachers and Students at PyconUK 2013</a></h1><p class="published_on">Monday 9th September 2013 (8:00AM)</p>

<p>I love my job. Designing and writing software (often using the
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language) is rewarding and
fun. I work with thoughtful colleagues, collaborate with passionate
<a href="http://fsf.org/about">free-software</a>
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">coders</a> and I'm
always learning something new (I also get to work with cool new
technology). Software developers <a href="/article/programming-concise-and-simple">build our digital future</a>.</p>

<p>Another group who help build the future are teachers. I was once a teacher,
a secondary head of music, and tended to work in schools that are politely
described as "challenging". It was the most difficult job I've ever done. I
have nothing but utter respect for my former colleagues who continue to do an
amazing job despite the well-meaning yet often frustrating bureaucracy that is the UK's education system.</p>

<p>And so we come to the most important group relating to the future:
students. I believe education should inspire a passion for learning that
leads students to autonomy: dedicating themselves to a life of their own
making. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch">Plutarch</a>
famously observed,</p>

<blockquote>
    "The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled."
</blockquote>

<p>On the 21st and 22nd of September we hope to bring these three groups
together for this year's community organised
<a href="http://pyconuk.org/">PyconUK</a> conference, held in Coventry. Why?
Because we believe interesting things happen when diverse groups of motivated
people work together. We expect many programming fires to be kindled as a
result.</p>

<p>There is a special teacher's track on Saturday 21st that includes talks and
workshops about teaching with the Python programming language. There will also
be opportunities to collaborate with some of the UK's top Python developers to
create educational resources and share programming ideas. Last year's event was
<a href="http://misscphilbin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/pyconuk-and-pythonedu.html">lots of fun</a>
and we expect this year's event to be just as fruitful for both teachers and
developers alike.</p>

<p>On Sunday 22nd we're holding a
<a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> for up to 40 kids to
learn about and have fun with Python, Raspberry Pi, programming Minecraft and
Arduino microcontrollers. This will be a first for PyconUK but we're being
helped by the intergalactic Raspberry Jambassador himself,
<a href="http://about.me/AlanODonohoe">Alan O'Donohoe</a> (he is, truly, out
of this world).</p>

<p>If you're a teacher and would like to attend you have two choices:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A single day-ticket for the Saturday teacher's track priced at only
&pound;35 (including lunch).</li>
    <li>A discounted full conference ticket priced at &pound;111.95 (includes the
Saturday evening conference dinner and attendance for the whole conference
Friday-Monday).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're a student, group organiser or would like to bring your own kids
along to Sunday's Raspberry Jam then the price is only &pound;5 per child with adults
attending at no cost.</p>

<p>To book tickets simply <a href="https://pyconuk2013.eventbrite.co.uk/">visit
the booking page</a> and use the promotional code MORTAR_BOARD for the
teacher's tickets or SCOLARIS_PYTHONIS for the Raspberry Jam.</p>

<p>Please don't hesitate to <a href="http://ntoll.org/contact">contact me</a>
if you have any questions.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you there to kindle some fires..!</p>

        <title>At Home with the Drogulus</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/drogulus-at-home</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/drogulus-at-home">At Home with the Drogulus</a></h1><p class="published_on">Monday 15th July 2013 (8:00AM)</p>

<p>Two nuggets of information:</p>

<ol>

<li>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6006393">recent post</a> on
the Hacker News website showed me that people appear to be interested in and
intrigued by my <a href="http://drogul.us">drogulus</a> project. Apparently,
I'm not the only one to find the prospect of a programmable peer-to-peer data
store designed to <a href="/article/ppdd">promote autonomy</a>
fascinating.</li>

<li>It's the school holidays and from next weekend Mary and the kids will be
away visiting relatives in Scotland for a fortnight. I, however, need to earn
money so will continue to work and stay at my new home alone. I will miss them
terribly.</li>

</ol>

<p>I'll have the middle weekend of the fortnight free from "dad duties" -
an opportunity I can use to work on the drogulus. I'll also be in an empty
house missing my wife and kids, so why not make it an open house and invite
interested friends to hack on the drogulus too?</p>

<p>Over the weekend I'd like to create a first draft of a formal specification
for Logos, the
<a href="/article/lisp-concise-and-simple">Lisp-like</a> programming language
used to program the drogulus. I have plenty of ideas but, due to the peer to
peer nature of the drogulus, the language will need some interesting
features and constraints. To be clear, the goal for the weekend is a worked out
specification for rather than implementation of Logos. I expect much of the
weekend will be taken up with discussion of language design and writing example
Logos code.</p>

<p>Logos needs to be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Simple enough that a ten year old child could write software with
    it.</li>
    <li>Powerful enough to be useful to professional programmers.</li>
    <li>Reliable enough that it can function usefully in a peer to peer
    context.</li>
    <li>Safe enough that it's impossible to overwhelm the available computing
    power of peers on the network.</li>
</ul>

<p>If creating such a Lisp like programming language sounds interesting (and I
realise you really do have to be a very special kind of person to think so)
then from the evening of Friday 26th July until the late afternoon of Sunday
28th July my house is the place to be. As they say, "be there, or be square"
(actually, you probably need to be pretty damn square in order to want to come
anyway). I'll try to get my current thoughts on Logos written down soon -
probably as a brain dump on this blog. As always constructive comments,
suggestions and critique will always be welcome.</p>

<p>Not everyone wants to spend <em>all</em> weekend inventing Lisp-y
programming languages so I'd welcome "day trip" guests too.</p>

<p>How will the weekend work?</p>

<ul>
    <li>I need to know you already.</li>
    <li>No more than a handful of people can stay over each evening (and you'll
    need to bring a sleeping bag). I can accommodate more people who are
    visiting just for the day.</li>
    <li>I'll provide food and drink - there's a Domino's franchise in
    Towcester ;-). There are good pubs in Towcester that we may want to visit,
    but I can only afford to pay for food and drink consumed at my house.</li>
    <li>I don't mind picking up / dropping off at Milton Keynes train
    station.</li>
    <li>You need to be a programmer of an appropriate level of expertise given
    what we'll be working on (I trust you to be the judge of that).</li>
    <li>You've read and agree with the
    <a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst">drogulus contributor's agreement</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Did I mention I have a nice garden to enjoy at my new house and I'm a
big fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">hammock
driven development</a>..?</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/hammock.jpg" alt="View from my hammock"/></p>

<p>If you're interested in coming over, <a href="/contact">drop me an email</a>
and we can work out the details. If you have any questions, please don't
hesitate to get in touch.</p>

        <title>Drogulus - Questions and Clarifications</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/drogulus-questions-and-clarifications</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/drogulus-questions-and-clarifications">Drogulus - Questions and Clarifications</a></h1><p class="published_on">Wednesday 22nd May 2013 (8:00AM)</p>

<p>Last weekend I gave a very short (15 minute)
<a href="/article/ppdd">talk on the drogulus</a>: a programmable peer-to-peer
data store that I've been working on in my own time. Pretty much all my answers
in the short Q/A that followed were a variation of "I don't know". I consider
this a success since it provided evidence for future avenues of investigation
that others have proposed about the drogulus (one of the purposes for giving
the talk).</p>

<p>I prefer to say "I don't know" then think about the problem and write a
considered response. I've had a couple of days to ponder the questions and
comments from the Q/A (and later discussions in the bar), and in this post I'll
attempt to answer, clarify or admit that, even upon reflection, I still don't
know.</p>

<p>I'll assume you've read the <a href="/article/ppdd">blog post of the
talk</a> before reading the following.</p>

<p><strong>What about flooding the network with Logos jobs? (or) How do you
solve the problem of the tragedy of the commons?</strong></p>

<p>Upon reflection I think this <em>is</em> a solvable problem. Put simply,
there must be costs for misbehaviour and rewards for collaboration. I
think a mechanism that uses both carrot and stick could be a solution (note
that I didn't say, <em>is the answer</em>). My guess is that the specifics of
a solution will become clearer if/when the drogulus gets used.</p>

<p>The drogulus is a peer-to-peer system: by virtue of the way the system works
peers have evidence of how each other behave. The ultimate punishment is to
ostracise misbehaving nodes from the network, cutting them off from data and
the latent computing power within the drogulus.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to run Logos jobs, nodes must have shown evidence that
they are "good citizens" of the network. Furthermore, there is the threat that
evidence of "bad" behaviour will result in punishment.</p>

<p>To some extent this feature already exists within the drogulus: every node
maintains a simple data structure called a
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/drogulus/dht/routingtable.py">routing table</a>
- the means of keeping track of peers on the network. To get in to another
node's routing table you must have been in contact with the node and
provided some useful information in a timely fashion. The number of
available slots in the routing table is limited by a constant called
<code>K</code>. Only the most reliable nodes get included in node's routing
tables and those that do not maintain good performance are removed and quickly
replaced.</p>

<p>In this way, the distributed hash table's nodes attempt to use the most
reliable peers to maintain the system's performance. Furthermore, if a node is
found to propagate a value that fails the cryptographic checks it is
immediately removed from routing tables no matter how reliable its prior
performance.</p>

<p>Something similar could be achieved for running Logos scripts. For example,
peers may only run Logos jobs from remote nodes that have already run a Logos
job for them (you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours) or from nodes that have
existed within the routing table and fulfilled a certain number of successful
interactions with the local node.</p>

<p>My aim is simply to think up a mechanism by which it costs nothing to be
a good citizen yet is fatally expensive to be disruptive.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if a third party attempts to block by IP
address?</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in the talk, areas of the key space are covered by many
different nodes. The IP address of a node has nothing to do with the key space
it covers. I presume a third party would be attempting to block access to a
key/value item stored in the drogulus rather than a specific machine. To block
an area of the key space a third party would have to take down
<strong>all</strong> nodes containing the target key/value item.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is easier said than done because:</p>

<ul>
    <li>There is no central list tracking which nodes contain what values.
    There's a pretty good chance you won't discover them all at any single
    point in time.</li>
    <li>Nodes are constantly joining and leaving the drogulus and replicating
    data between each other. The set of nodes containing a certain item is
    constantly changing.
    &#928;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#8165;&#949;&#8150;.</li>
    <li>If nodes <em>are</em> blocked then the drogulus quickly routes around
    the failing nodes through the mechanism of the routing table (see
    above).</li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine some of the properties of the drogulus are like a
swarming flock of starlings: a dynamic system consisting of a multitude of
independent parts that are constantly acting on and reacting to each other.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/swarm.jpg" alt="Swarm of starlings"/></p>

<p><strong>What is the etymology of "drogulus" and "logos"?</strong></p>

<p>A drogulus is an entity whose presence is unverifiable, because it has no
physical effects. The atheist philosopher
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Ayer">A.J.Ayer</a>
coined it as a way of ridiculing the belief system of his friend, the Jesuit
philosopher,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Copleston">Frederick
Copleston</a>.</p>

<p>In 1949 Ayer and Copleston took part in a radio debate about the existence of
God. The debate then went back and forth, until Ayer came up with the following
as a way of illustrating the point that Copleston's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>
had no content
because there was no way of testing the truth of metaphysical assertions. He
said:</p>

<blockquote>"I say, 'There's a "drogulus" over there,' and you say, 'What?' and
I say, 'drogulus' and you say 'What's a drogulus?' Well, I say, 'I can't
describe what a drogulus is, because it's not the sort of thing you can see or
touch, it has no physical effects of any kind, but it's a disembodied
being.' And you say, 'Well how am I to tell if it's there or it's not
there?' and I say, 'There's no way of telling. Everything's just the same
if it's there or it's not there. But the fact is it's there. There's a
drogulus there standing just behind you, spiritually behind you.' Does that
makes sense?"</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the natural answer Ayer was waiting for was "No, of course it
doesn't make sense." Therefore, the implication would be that metaphysics is
like the "drogulus" ~ a being which cannot be seen and has no perceptible
effects. If Ayer can get to that point, he can claim that any kind of belief
in the Christian God or in metaphysical principles in general is really
contrary to our logical and scientific understanding of the world.</p>

<p>This appeals greatly to my sense of humour and I've always thought it'd be
a fun name for a software project. Especially a project like this one. :-)</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/ajayer.jpg" alt="Portrait of A.J.Ayer"/><br/>
<small>A.J.Ayer</small></p>

<p>Logos
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</a>)
is a term used by the pre-Socratic philosopher,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, to mean
several different things: account, explanation, reason, organising principle,
wisdom, nature or saying. It's the etymological root of the modern
English word "logic". I do not use it in the biblical sense where it means
the word of God (I refer readers to the explanation of "drogulus" above).</p>

<p>It seems to me an appropriate choice of name for a computer language.</p>

<p><strong>It's a complex problem and you don't know what you're
doing!</strong></p>

<p>I won't contest that!</p>

<p>It's a fun personal project. If it is useful then people will use
it. At the very least it's a helpful learning exercise for me (which is, in
itself, a positive outcome).</p>

<p>However, a complex problem may not entail a complex solution. Rather, it
only needs to work. Furthermore, while thinking about the drogulus I've
attempted to work out the simplest possible solution given whatever the
abstract problem I've needed to solve.</p>

<p>As computing pioneer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony
Hoare</a> explains,</p>

<blockquote>"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is
to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other
way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The
first method is far more difficult."</blockquote>

<p>I'm aiming for Hoare's first method of constructing software.</p>

<p><strong>What's being sent down the wire?</strong></p>

<p>Dictionary like objects (that are themselves valid statements in Logos) are
encoded using <a href="http://msgpack.org/">msgpack</a> and sent as a
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt">netstring</a> to remote nodes
over
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite">TCP/IP</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How does the cryptographic signing work?</strong></p>

<p>The relevant code can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/drogulus/crypto.py">crypto.py</a>
module. I use the popular
<a href="https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto">PyCrypto</a> library for all
cryptographic functionality.</p>

<p>Put simply, each item encompassing a key/value pair includes the following
fields:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>value</code> - the value to store</li>
    <li><code>timestamp</code> - a UNIX timestamp representing when the item
    was created (so it's easy to discern the latest version of an item)</li>
    <li><code>expires</code> - a UNIX timestamp beyond which the item is
    expired and should be ignored</li>
    <li><code>name</code> - a meaningful name for the key</li>
    <li><code>meta</code> - a list of tuples containing key/value strings for
    user defined metadata about the item</li>
    <li><code>public_key</code> - the originator's public key</li>
    <li><code>sig</code> - a cryptographic signature created using the
    originator's private key with the <code>value</code>,
    <code>timestamp</code>, <code>expires</code>, <code>name</code> and
    <code>meta</code> values</li>
    <li><code>key</code> - the SHA512 value of the compound key (based upon the
    <code>public_key</code> and <code>name</code> fields) used as the actual
    key on the distributed hash table</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>public_key</code> field is used to validate the <code>sig</code>
value. If this is OK then the compound key is checked using the obviously valid
<code>public_key</code> and <code>name</code> fields.</p>

<p>This ensures both the provenance of the data and that it hasn't been
tampered with.</p>

<p>Any items that don't pass the cryptographic checks are ignored and nodes
that propagate them are punished by being blocked.</p>

<p><strong>How is it licensed?</strong></p>

<p>Under the
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/LICENSE">GNU Affero
general public license version 3</a>. I usually license my code under a more
liberal license (e.g. the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>
license) but decided to use the AGPLv3 because this is the reference version of
the drogulus and should always remain open (if anything comes of the drogulus,
I hope many different implementations will exist).</p>

<p><strong>Do you want or need help?</strong></p>
