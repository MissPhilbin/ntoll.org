</blockquote>

<p>Last weekend was PyconUK. You can read all about how successful it was
<a href="http://pyconuk.net/PostConf">elsewhere</a>. I want to focus on the
education track: two days that brought together teachers, students and
developers. This was the second year we'd run an education track and this
time round it was sponsored by
<a href="http://corp.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a>.

<p>I've been to many educational conferences, both when I was a teacher and,
more recently, as a developer interested in education. Apart from a few
exceptions I usually feel frustrated by the lack of concrete and tangible
outcomes from such events. They end up as people talking shop and complaining
about the current system concluding with a call to action that "something must
be done (think of the children)".</p>

<p>Of course something must be done.</p>

<p>Such meetings are where one expects plans to come together for
"something to be done". Having the space to reflect with, learn from and
challenge each other is how we discover the concrete details of the
"something to be done". Unfortunately, "something must be done" often turns
into "you can't fight the system" or some other similar acknowledgement of
defeat ("life's too short" and "I'm too busy coping" are two other
variations). This is a shame because such concessions are more a reflection of
a person's point of view than it is on their ability to do something.</p>

<p>So we asked ourselves, "what could be done about this state of affairs?"
and replied with the PyconUK education track.</p>

<p>Our outlook was simple:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Interesting things happen when you bring together a diverse group of
    smart people who are all passionate about the same subject (in this case
    programming in education). Diversity is the antidote to educational
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</a>.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus
    Torvalds</a>, the creator of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux</a> and one of
    the world's most celebrated programmers once said that,
    "<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132">talk is cheap, show me
    the code</a>". We wanted to focus on practical and immediately useful
    activities. Close collaboration between teachers and developers was
    key to making this happen (more on this below).</li>

    <li>People work best when they're having fun. Remember your favourite
    teacher? You probably don't think of them because they were good
    at classroom discipline, marking or producing spiffy lesson plans (not
    that these <em>may</em> be important). Rather, I'd wager they were your
    favourite because they infected you with their own enthusiasm for their
    subject. We wanted teachers, students and developers to leave PyconUK in
    a highly contagious state.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I watched this video from teacher
<a href="http://about.me/benllewellynsmith">Ben Smith</a> I knew we'd struck
gold.<p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qOya5R9g1T8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Here we have teachers and developers collaborating, asking questions of
each other (there's no such thing as a stupid question in this situation) and
producing something that can be easily adapted to work in the classroom.</p>

<p>Another highlight from the teachers was
<a href="https://twitter.com/vikkiville">Vikki Dodd</a> and her colleagues
eloquently describing to the massed ranks of programmers the sort of hurdles,
expectations and successes that a UK teacher of ICT encounters. I'm proud to
say the most common response from the developers was, "how can we help?" to
which the answer was to
<a href="http://www.stemnet.org.uk/content/ambassadors">become a STEM
ambassador</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/">Martin O'Hanlon</a> deserves a
special mention since his contribution brought everyone together in the most
practical of ways: he inspired us by describing how to use
<a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> as a sort of programmable
digital Lego via <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and a
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. In the video below
Martin succinctly describes and shows us what we got up to.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JRMbKHb4ixo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>We wanted to involve kids in our education track because many of us
organising and attending PyconUK were first inspired by programming when we
were kids. Put simply, we wanted to inspire the next generation of programmers
by letting them play with code in the company of contagious teachers and
expert Pythonistas.</p>

<p>Happily PyconUK has been graced by the presence of
<a href="http://about.me/AlanODonohoe">Alan O'Donohoe</a> for three years in
a row. He's a fellow Pythonista and, more importantly, an inspiring teacher
who is the source of the world-wide phenomenon known as
<a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a>. We had, in our midst,
the most qualified person in the world to pull off an inspiring day of
programming for kids.</p>

<p>We were not let down.</p>

<p>Rather than describe what went on I think it best to let the kids (young
and old) tell us themselves:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yerWCR3mppk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u4IMlpmjbYg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PXPoc9HCTlo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZJFdeDpo8w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Alan also <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/102569475330772729673/albums/5926578135551904161">took some photographs of the event</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to finish with two points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The gender split among the kids was 50/50. This bodes well.</li>
    <li>Everyone who attended PyconUK 2013 (be they teachers or students
    learning Python, or developers learning how to teach) learned by
    doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">dead Greek philosopher</a>
was right. Rather than talking about things, collaboratively doing stuff leads
to tangible and concrete results like infecting teachers, students and
developers with an enthusiasm for programming.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, we'll be repeating the education track next year.
It'll be one of many events where teachers, students and developers come
together to collaboratively inspire each other. Why not try Alan's next
<a href="https://rjamboree14.eventbrite.co.uk/">Raspberry Jamboree</a> if you
want to get involved..?</p>

        <title>Teachers and Students at PyconUK 2013</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/education-at-pyconuk2013</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/education-at-pyconuk2013">Teachers and Students at PyconUK 2013</a></h1><p class="published_on">Monday 9th September 2013 (8:00AM)</p>

<p>I love my job. Designing and writing software (often using the
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language) is rewarding and
fun. I work with thoughtful colleagues, collaborate with passionate
<a href="http://fsf.org/about">free-software</a>
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">coders</a> and I'm
always learning something new (I also get to work with cool new
technology). Software developers <a href="/article/programming-concise-and-simple">build our digital future</a>.</p>

<p>Another group who help build the future are teachers. I was once a teacher,
a secondary head of music, and tended to work in schools that are politely
described as "challenging". It was the most difficult job I've ever done. I
have nothing but utter respect for my former colleagues who continue to do an
amazing job despite the well-meaning yet often frustrating bureaucracy that is the UK's education system.</p>

<p>And so we come to the most important group relating to the future:
students. I believe education should inspire a passion for learning that
leads students to autonomy: dedicating themselves to a life of their own
making. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch">Plutarch</a>
famously observed,</p>

<blockquote>
    "The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled."
</blockquote>

<p>On the 21st and 22nd of September we hope to bring these three groups
together for this year's community organised
<a href="http://pyconuk.org/">PyconUK</a> conference, held in Coventry. Why?
Because we believe interesting things happen when diverse groups of motivated
people work together. We expect many programming fires to be kindled as a
result.</p>

<p>There is a special teacher's track on Saturday 21st that includes talks and
workshops about teaching with the Python programming language. There will also
be opportunities to collaborate with some of the UK's top Python developers to
create educational resources and share programming ideas. Last year's event was
<a href="http://misscphilbin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/pyconuk-and-pythonedu.html">lots of fun</a>
and we expect this year's event to be just as fruitful for both teachers and
developers alike.</p>

<p>On Sunday 22nd we're holding a
<a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a> for up to 40 kids to
learn about and have fun with Python, Raspberry Pi, programming Minecraft and
Arduino microcontrollers. This will be a first for PyconUK but we're being
helped by the intergalactic Raspberry Jambassador himself,
<a href="http://about.me/AlanODonohoe">Alan O'Donohoe</a> (he is, truly, out
of this world).</p>

<p>If you're a teacher and would like to attend you have two choices:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A single day-ticket for the Saturday teacher's track priced at only
&pound;35 (including lunch).</li>
    <li>A discounted full conference ticket priced at &pound;111.95 (includes the
Saturday evening conference dinner and attendance for the whole conference
Friday-Monday).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're a student, group organiser or would like to bring your own kids
along to Sunday's Raspberry Jam then the price is only &pound;5 per child with adults
attending at no cost.</p>

<p>To book tickets simply <a href="https://pyconuk2013.eventbrite.co.uk/">visit
the booking page</a> and use the promotional code MORTAR_BOARD for the
teacher's tickets or SCOLARIS_PYTHONIS for the Raspberry Jam.</p>

<p>Please don't hesitate to <a href="http://ntoll.org/contact">contact me</a>
if you have any questions.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you there to kindle some fires..!</p>

        <title>At Home with the Drogulus</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/drogulus-at-home</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/drogulus-at-home">At Home with the Drogulus</a></h1><p class="published_on">Monday 15th July 2013 (8:00AM)</p>

<p>Two nuggets of information:</p>

<ol>

<li>A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6006393">recent post</a> on
the Hacker News website showed me that people appear to be interested in and
intrigued by my <a href="http://drogul.us">drogulus</a> project. Apparently,
I'm not the only one to find the prospect of a programmable peer-to-peer data
store designed to <a href="/article/ppdd">promote autonomy</a>
fascinating.</li>

<li>It's the school holidays and from next weekend Mary and the kids will be
away visiting relatives in Scotland for a fortnight. I, however, need to earn
money so will continue to work and stay at my new home alone. I will miss them
terribly.</li>

</ol>

<p>I'll have the middle weekend of the fortnight free from "dad duties" -
an opportunity I can use to work on the drogulus. I'll also be in an empty
house missing my wife and kids, so why not make it an open house and invite
interested friends to hack on the drogulus too?</p>

<p>Over the weekend I'd like to create a first draft of a formal specification
for Logos, the
<a href="/article/lisp-concise-and-simple">Lisp-like</a> programming language
used to program the drogulus. I have plenty of ideas but, due to the peer to
peer nature of the drogulus, the language will need some interesting
features and constraints. To be clear, the goal for the weekend is a worked out
specification for rather than implementation of Logos. I expect much of the
weekend will be taken up with discussion of language design and writing example
Logos code.</p>

<p>Logos needs to be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Simple enough that a ten year old child could write software with
    it.</li>
    <li>Powerful enough to be useful to professional programmers.</li>
    <li>Reliable enough that it can function usefully in a peer to peer
    context.</li>
    <li>Safe enough that it's impossible to overwhelm the available computing
    power of peers on the network.</li>
</ul>

<p>If creating such a Lisp like programming language sounds interesting (and I
realise you really do have to be a very special kind of person to think so)
then from the evening of Friday 26th July until the late afternoon of Sunday
28th July my house is the place to be. As they say, "be there, or be square"
(actually, you probably need to be pretty damn square in order to want to come
anyway). I'll try to get my current thoughts on Logos written down soon -
probably as a brain dump on this blog. As always constructive comments,
suggestions and critique will always be welcome.</p>

<p>Not everyone wants to spend <em>all</em> weekend inventing Lisp-y
programming languages so I'd welcome "day trip" guests too.</p>

<p>How will the weekend work?</p>

<ul>
    <li>I need to know you already.</li>
    <li>No more than a handful of people can stay over each evening (and you'll
    need to bring a sleeping bag). I can accommodate more people who are
    visiting just for the day.</li>
    <li>I'll provide food and drink - there's a Domino's franchise in
    Towcester ;-). There are good pubs in Towcester that we may want to visit,
    but I can only afford to pay for food and drink consumed at my house.</li>
    <li>I don't mind picking up / dropping off at Milton Keynes train
    station.</li>
    <li>You need to be a programmer of an appropriate level of expertise given
    what we'll be working on (I trust you to be the judge of that).</li>
    <li>You've read and agree with the
    <a href="https://github.com/ntoll/drogulus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst">drogulus contributor's agreement</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Did I mention I have a nice garden to enjoy at my new house and I'm a
big fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">hammock
driven development</a>..?</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/hammock.jpg" alt="View from my hammock"/></p>

<p>If you're interested in coming over, <a href="/contact">drop me an email</a>
and we can work out the details. If you have any questions, please don't
hesitate to get in touch.</p>
