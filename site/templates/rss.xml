<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toomuchdew/5496442190/"><img src="/static/images/lego.jpg" alt="lego instructions"/></a>

<p>Over the coming weeks I will publish a set of articles that are part of a
series called "concise and simple". Each article will be about an area of
computing that interests me but will be no longer that 1500 words nor assume
previous knowledge of the subject under scrutiny.</p>

<p>I have two aims:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To create resources that may be useful for others.</li>
    <li>To explain in a simple yet engaging style the essence of a highly
    technical subject.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first aim is an act of community service, the second is a personal
challenge.</p>

<p>I hope to publish the first article in the next few days: "The Internet ~
Concise and Simple".</p>

        <title>The Twelve Days of Python</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/12-days-of-python</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/12-days-of-python">The Twelve Days of Python</a></h1><p class="published_on">Saturday 1st December 2012 (09:30AM)</p>

<p>One of my less pleasant pass-times is butchering the English language with
dodgy verse. I already have a track record
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/fuzzymandias">wrangling well known poems</a>
for friends or
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/programmer_pythonical">re-hashing
libretto</a> for vocal performance.</p>

<p>Last week, in the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=python-uk&uio=d4">#python-uk</a>
IRC channel, there was discussion of what a Pythonic Christmas carol would
look like.</p>

<p>Today, given that it's the season of peace and goodwill to all men (and
women), I've decided to ignore that sentiment and publish what is, perhaps, my
most diabolical creation yet. I give you, "The Twelve Days of Python" (sung to
the tune of... well, I'm sure you can figure it out):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some of the lines I discarded were,

        <title>Northackton and the Useless Machine</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/northackton-useless-machine</link>
        <description><h1><a href="/article/northackton-useless-machine">Northackton and the Useless Machine</a></h1><p class="published_on">Sunday 18th November 2012 (05:30PM)</p>

<p>When time permits I really enjoy attending
<a href="http://northackton.stdin.co.uk/blog/">Northackton</a>, a local hacker
/ maker group. Last Monday I took my middle son, Sam (8 years old), along to
a meeting advertised as a "geek santa" session - an opportunity for attendees
to build a geeky gift for a loved one in time for Christmas.</p>

<p>We were all there to make
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Most-Useless-Machine/step1/Background/">useless machines</a> - wonderfully quirky devices imagined by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifical_Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> pioneer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a>
and first built by the father of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Theory">information theory</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>.</p>

<p>Between ten to fifteen of us turned up to be greeted by
friend-of-Northackton <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/msraynsford/">Martin Raynsford</a>.
Martin provided us all with kits (also available via
<a href="http://msraynsford.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/new-smaller-useless-box.html">his website</a>), instructions, encouragement and a helping
hand when required. After a couple of hours we were all the proud owners of a
working useless machine! Sam was especially pleased because he had a go
soldering and the other attendees were very patient (and welcoming) by
answering all his inevitable questions. He was also very impressed with the
well provisioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuck_shop">tuck
shop</a> (lots of chocolate and crisps!).</p>

<p>But, what is a useless machine..? I'll let Sam explain...</p>

<p>If you ever find yourself in the Northampton area and at a loose end on
a Monday evening, visit the <a href="http://northackton.stdin.co.uk/blog/">Northackton website</a>
and check if there's a meeting, come along and say "hi". You could also
<a href="http://twitter.com/northackton">follow the group on Twitter</a>.</p>
